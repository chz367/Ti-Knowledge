Abstract: A globular α recrystallization has been discovered at the surface of net shape electron beam powder-bed fusion (PBF-EB) Ti-6Al-4V alloy parts. This recrystallization is the result of powder recovery blasting followed by hot isostatic pressing treatment (HIP), which mimics the thermomechanical treatment necessary to achieve globularization in wrought Ti-6Al-4V. The thickness of the globular surface α is variable depending on the blasting intensity as well as the presence of surface protrusions that block the line-of-sight of the blasting media. The globular layer contains a 0001 orientation relationship parallel to the blasting direction, plus a low intragranular orientation deviation, when compared to the bulk. The results indicate that this globular α at the surface may be present for all net-shape Ti-6Al-4V components that have been manufactured via PBF-EB and subjected to a HIP treatment. Tunable fatigue and wear performance may be possible through controlled blasting parameters and globular surface layer thickness.
Abstract: Metallic additive manufacturing (AM) provides a customizable and tailorable manufacturing process for new engineering designs and technologies. The greatest challenge currently facing metallic AM is maintaining control of microstructural evolution during solidification and any solid state phase transformations during the build process. Ti-6Al-4V has been extensively surveyed in this regard, with the potential solid state and solidification microstructures explored at length. This work evaluates the applicability of previously determined crystallographic markers of microstructural condition observed in electron beam melting powder bed fusion (PBF-EB) builds of Ti-6Al-4V in a directed energy deposition (DED) build process. The aim of this effort is to elucidate whether or not these specific crystallographic textures are useful tools for indicating microstructural conditions in AM variants beyond PBF-EB. Parent β-Ti grain size was determined to be directly related to α-Ti textures in the DED build process, and the solid state microstructural condition could be inferred from the intensity of specific α-Ti orientations. Qualitative trends on the as-solidified β-Ti grain size were also determined to be related to the presence of a fiber texture, and proposed as a marker for as-solidified grain size in any cubic metal melted by AM. Analysis of the DED Ti-6Al-4V build also demonstrated a near complete fracture of the build volume, suspected to originate from accumulated thermal stresses in the solid state. Crack propagation was found to only appreciably occur in regions of slow cooling with large α+β colonies. Schmid factors for the basal and prismatic α-Ti systems explained the observed crack pathway, including slower bifurcation in colonies with lower Schmid factors of both slip systems. Colony morphologies and localized equiaxed β-Ti solidification were also found to originate from build pauses during production and uneven heating of the build edges during deposition. Tailoring of DED Ti-6Al-4V microstructures with the insight gained here is proposed, along with cautionary insight on preventing unplanned build pauses to maintain an informed and controlled thermal environment for microstructural control.
Abstract: Direct aging and solution-aging treatments were implemented on a laser powder bed fusion-processed Ti-6Al-4V alloy to enhance its tribological performance. Dry sliding wear tests over a wide range of normal loads (2.5–40 N) and sliding velocities (50–800 rpm) were employed to investigate their comprehensive wear behavior. The results indicate that high-density Ti3Al precipitates were formed, and the decomposition of α'→α + β occurred during the aging treatments. A higher aging-hardening response of the studied alloy was achieved after the β solution treatment relative to the as-built state. The worn morphologies and wear mechanisms depend significantly on the microstructural characteristics, applied loads, and sliding velocities.
Abstract: In this study, the nanotube formation and corrosion behavior of Ti-6Al-4V alloy with α- and β-phases were researched with various experimental instruments. For this study, nanotube formation on the sample was performed using the anodic oxidation method by applying a voltage of 30 V using a direct current power supply for 1 h using a 1.0 M H3PO4 + 0.8 wt.% NaF solution at 25 °C. The corrosion properties of specimens were examined by potentiodynamic testing (potential range of -1000–1500 mV) in a 0.9% NaCl solution using a potentiostat. The nanotube morphology of the alloys was observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The nanotubes in the α-phase were uniformly formed on the surface of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy, but nanotubes in the β-phase were irregularly formed. The nanotube-formed alloy had a wider passivation range and higher corrosion current density than the bulk alloy. The morphologies of the corrosion surfaces show that the edge trace around the β-phase was reduced, and the anatase phase increased on the corroded surface. In cross-sectioned nanotube layer after corrosion test, a deep pit was observed in the part where the nanotubes were removed. XRD analysis showed that the anatase and rutile phases were not formed in bulk alloys, but anatase and rutile phases were detected in the nanotube formed alloy, and the peak of the anatase increased on the corroded surface. From the result of potentiostatic test, the variation of current density from the beginning is almost the same, but the current density of the nanotube formed surface was slightly higher than that of non-nanotube formed surface with time.
Abstract: Ca vapor deoxidation—which involves controlling oxygen through deoxidation on the surface of Ti—is important to ensure the quality of Ti and its alloys. We systematically investigated various surface properties before and after Ca vapor deoxidation of bulk Ti and Ti–6Al–4V alloy with small specific surface areas. The relationship between surface characteristics and deoxidation is discussed. The oxygen concentrations of Ti and Ti–6Al–4V decreased to 555 and 565 ppm, respectively, upon Ca vapor deoxidation. Moreover, the surface roughness increased, the surface oxide layer was slightly thinned, and the oxygen content of the matrix decreased. The surface chemical states of Ti before and after the deoxidation were mainly the tetravalent oxidation state (TiO2) and metallic state toward the inside. The deoxidation produced a Ca oxide layer on the surfaces of Ti and Ti–6Al–4V and increased the surface roughness by creating craters on the surface. The deoxidation reactions included heterogeneous Ca/CaO nucleation and growth on the Ti surface, resulting in localized oxygen diffusion. Craters were formed on the surfaces of Ti and Ti–6Al–4V owing to the Ca oxide layer. Local oxygen diffusion and reactions with Ti and Al components enlarged the craters.
Abstract: Statement of problem How the corrosion properties of cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) and Ti (Ti-6Al-4V) alloys, frequently used in dental prostheses, are affected by different production methods is unclear. Purpose: The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare Co-Cr and Ti-6Al-4V alloys produced by computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) milling or laser sintering in terms of corrosion, ion release, and surface hardness. Material and methods: Co-Cr and Ti-6Al-4V specimens were produced by CAD-CAM milling and direct metal laser sintering/selective laser sintering techniques. Testing included Vickers hardness and then open circuit potential (OCP), Tafel extrapolation, and static immersion to determine the corrosion behavior. The study used an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer to measure ion release. The data were analyzed by using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests, with Bonferroni correction (α=.05). Results: The Ti-6Al-4V laser-sintered group showed the highest Vickers hardness value (P<.008), the lowest OCP value (P<.008), and the lowest corrosion potential (Vcorr) value (P<.008). The corrosion current density (Icorr) level of the Co-Cr CAD-CAM milling group was statistically significantly lower than that of the Ti-6Al-4V CAD-CAM milling and the Ti-6Al-4V laser-sintered groups (P<.008). The highest weight change was observed in the Ti-6Al-4V laser-sintered group. The Co, Cr, and Ti ion emissions were higher in specimens produced by laser sintering (P<.05), and no statistically significant difference in terms of Al and V oscillations was found among the groups (P>.05). Conclusions: Ti-6Al-4V alloys may be a good alternative for patients with Co-Cr allergies, but as per the results of this study, Co-Cr still seems more suitable for clinical use.
Abstract: A gradient microstructure was successfully fabricated by high-frequency induction quenching treatment (HFIQT) to improve the mechanical behavior of Ti-6Al-4V alloy in this work. Microstructural evolution was systematically characterized by electron backscattered diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that the gradient microstructure of the alloy after HFIQT and aging varied from a fine αs lamellae decomposed from α′-martensite at the surface layer to a bimodal microstructure at the center. Moreover, the alloy with gradient microstructure presents an optimal strength-ductility synergy. The tensile test results showed that a best strength plastic product UT of 12433.1 MPa·%, an ultimate strength of 1231 MPa and an elongation of 10.1 % were obtained after HFIQT for 5.2 s and aging at 400 °C for 6 h. The tensile strength of the alloy aged at 400 °C markedly increased with the increase in soaking time from 5.1 to 5.3 s during HFIQT. Meanwhile, the tensile strength of the alloy slightly increased with the decrease in aging temperature from 550 to 400 °C during HFIQT. Surprisingly, the elongation of the alloy also increased with decreasing aging temperature. The effects of the gradient microstructure characteristic on strength and ductility of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy were discussed.
Abstract: Titanium alloys are materials difficult to machine due to their excellent characteristics. In the machining process of these alloy materials, it is critical to determine the important coefficient cutting parameters such as depth of cut (ap), cutting speed (Vc), feed rate (fr), and cutting length (Lc) on tool wear (VB), and to simplify them by creating a mathematical expression. The effects of cutting parameters on VB were explored experimentally, in this study, by turning the Ti-6Al-4V alloy at various cutting parameters. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and Genetic Expression Programming (GEP) methods were used to examine the acquired data. The mathematical expression derived from GEP was simplified. Increasing the cutting parameter values resulted in an increase in VB. The analyses revealed that the parameter of Vc had a considerable impact on VB. The best performance (R2) from MLR analyzes was determined as 0.705. This performance was computed as 0.896 in stepwise MLR (SMLR) and 0.96 in GEP. The performance value was found to be 0.911 by simplifying the mathematical expression derived from GEP. It was observed that the analysis of parameter values of ap, Vc, fr and Lc on estimation performance of VB with the proposed GEP method was appropriate.
Abstract: Titanium alloys are key materials for aerospace and turbine industries. Direct energy deposition (DED) is one additive manufacturing method of interest for titanium alloy repair technology. One notable feature of directed energy deposition (DED) technique is the anisotropy of the microstructure due to the build directions and local heating during layer-by-layer formations. To explore the anisotropy in fatigue crack growth (FCG) properties, single-notched, compact specimens were cut and machined from thin “repaired coupon”, i.e., half AM and half wrought Ti–6Al–4V coupon, perpendicular and parallel to the build layers; the geometry was smaller than that required by standard crack growth testing procedures. Using these small coupons, fracture properties were attained for crack growth in either parallel or perpendicular directions with respect to the build layers. Direct current potential drop (DCPD) was utilized to monitor and measured crack length during fatigue. Optical and scanning electron microscopy was performed to investigate the failure mechanisms and microstructural morphology of polished cross-section and fractured surfaces, respectively. The results show that the crack growth direction parallel to the build layer (perpendicular to the build direction) had lower FCG resistance compared to crack growth direction perpendicular to the build layer (parallel to the build direction). The difference in the FCG rate is attributed to the microstructural features and the materials growth directions. Therefore, these clearly findings show that microstructure characteristics have strong influence on fatigue crack growth behavior in both directions of growth as observed in this study.
Abstract: Metal Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology is an emerging technology in biomedical field due to its unique ability to manufacture customized implants [Patients-specific Implants (PSIs)] replicating the complex bone structure from the relevant metal powders. PSIs could be developed through any AM technology, but the ultimate challenge lies in integrating the metallic implant with the living bone. Considering this aspect, in the present study, Ti alloy (Ti–6Al–4V) powder has been used to fabricate scaffolds of channel type macropores with 0–60% porosity using selective laser melting (SLM) and subsequent post-treatments paving way for surface microporosities. Surface chemical and subsequent heat treatments were carried out on thus developed Ti alloy scaffolds to improve its bioactivity, antibacterial activity and osteoblastic cell compatibility. NaOH and subsequent Ca(NO3)2/AgNO3 treatment induced the formation of a nanoporous network structure decorated with Ca–Ag ions. Ag nanoparticles covering the entire scaffold provided antibacterial activity and the presence of Ca2+ ions with anatase TiO2 layer further improved the bioactivity and osteoblastic cell compatibility of the scaffold. Therefore, SLM technology combined with heat treatment and surface modification could be effectively utilized to create macro-micro-nano structure scaffolds of Ti alloy that are bioactive, antibacterial, and cytocompatible.
Abstract: In the present work, several large Ti–6Al–4V blocks were successfully fabricated by high-power laser metal deposition (HP-LMD). The high cycle fatigue (HCF) property and fatigue crack growth (FCG) behavior of the as-build Ti–6Al–4V alloy were investigated from two sampling directions (horizontal and vertical). The results showed that the fatigue limit of horizontal and vertical specimens was 357.5 MPa and 358.57 MPa, respectively. However, the HCF performance of vertical specimens was superior to horizontal specimen under a high-stress level. In addition, the HCF performance of both horizontal and vertical specimens was inferior to the wrought Ti–6Al–4V. Meanwhile, the FCG rate of vertical specimen was lower than that of horizontal specimen in both near-threshold region and Paris region. The anisotropic microstructure (prior β columnar grains with preferential orientation and α colonies) was found to be the main reason that contributed to an anisotropic HCF property and FCG behavior. For horizontal specimen, the fatigue crack interacted with only one or two columnar grains, thus leading to a lower FCG resistance. For vertical specimen, the fatigue crack interacted with multiple columnar grains, which led to a better plasticity and enhanced FCG resistance.
Abstract: For the first time, four-point bending fatigue behavior of a Ti-6Al-4V alloy reinforced with 1 wt% nano-yttria-stabilized zirconia and processed by laser powder bed fusion was investigated. In a quest for clarification on the effect of the hot isostatic pressing (HIP) on the fatigue outcomes, both untreated and HIPed specimens were studied. The former material indicated relatively modest fatigue resistance mainly due to the presence of inherent processing defects, whereas the latter one revealed a promising fatigue strength in comparison with unreinforced Ti-6Al-4V and exhibited transgranular fatigue crack nucleation provoked by the crystallographic slip in long-length layers of α grain.
Abstract: Hot Isostatic Pressing(HIP) is a thermomechanical post-processing technique widely used in Additive Manufacturing parts to reduce internal defects, such as entrapped-gas-pores or lack-of-fusion, which have a great influence on the mechanical and fatigue properties of the material. In this paper, the effect of a non-conventional HIP-cycle on the fatigue behavior of a Ti-6Al-4V alloy manufactured by Selective Laser melting (SLM) is studied. The HIP-cycle examined in this study is carried out at pressure of 200 MPa and a temperature of 850 °C for 2 h. Moreover, the cooling process is faster than that obtained from conventional furnace cooling rates, with the aim to limit the microstructural coarsening effects that affect the fatigue behavior. For the study, an extensive experimental fatigue program was carried out which included a first batch of SLM specimens tested under as-built conditions, a second batch of SLM specimens subjected to the present HIP process, and a third batch of specimens of a reference wrought processed material obtained by rolling and annealing processes. The microstructure of the material, before and after HIPping, is analyzed and a fractographic analysis is carried out to study the mechanism of crack initiation and its relation to the fatigue behavior. The results show that the present HIP-process allows for very good material densification, a microstructure that shows minimal coarsening effects, and good fatigue properties comparable to the conventional wrought processed material.
Abstract: Issues related to the machinability of difficult-to-machine materials such as Titanium and Nickel base superalloys are well explicated in the literature. In this regard, a novel study, applying ultrasonic vibration along with MQL and LCO2, is proposed to enhance the machinability of Ti-6Al-4V. In this regard, this article attempts to analyze machinability of Ti-6Al-4V in conventional and Ultrasonic Assisted Turning (UAT) under dry, wet, MQL and LCO2. The experiments are performed on an in-house developed ultrasonic assisted turning setup, keeping all the machining parameters constant. The main tool wear mechanisms observed are diffusion, adhesion, abrasion, and built-up edge formation in both cutting strategies. Moreover, the LCO2 and ultrasonic vibration significantly reduce specific cutting energy without compromising the surface roughness and tool life. Ultimately, the LCO2, along with ultrasonic assisted turning, promotes sustainability in the machining of Ti-6Al-4V.
Abstract: Ti-6Al-4V alloy is one of the most widely used material in both research as well as in commercial industries at present due to its high strength-to-weight ratio, low density and excellent high-temperature properties. Understanding the behaviour of this alloy at various deformation conditions (strain, strain rate and temperature) is crucial to fit the material in demanding applications. In our present work, the mechanical behaviour of α + β dual phase Ti-6Al-4V alloy is studied in the temperature ranging from 25 ℃ to 200 ℃ and rate of deformation ranging from 10-3 s−1 to 104 s−1. Tensile tests were done using uniaxial tensile tester for quasi-static range of deformation and Split-Hopkinson bar machine for dynamic range of deformation. Post deformation fracture surface analysis were carried out to understand the effects of strain rate and temperature variations on the deformation behaviour, and to establish a structure–property correlation. For the studied range of deformation parameters, constitutive models are developed. As Johnson-Cook model is one of the widely used model in various numerical analysis software, a modified Johnson-Cook model has been developed for the alloy. Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI) is found to be an efficient tool these days to solve complex problems in various fields of engineering. An attempt is also made in this study to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) framework for the prediction of flow stress at various deformation condition for Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Our study revealed that the AI based ANN technique is more efficient in calculating the flow stress as compared with the traditional Johnson-Cook model.
Abstract: The choice of manufacturing process plays a vital role in producing a medical device with a few problems; one of the best manufacturing processes for achieving superior physical and mechanical properties is transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding. The effect of bonding time in the range of 5–45 min on the microstructural and mechanical characterizations of the joint by an ultra-thin Cu interlayer with a thickness of 10 µm was investigated. The results revealed that the dominant phase is Ti2Cu intermetallic compound (IMCs) in the joint zone in all samples. It was shown that intensive metallurgical reactions happened at the interface of cp-Ti/Cu/Ti-6Al-4V, and the joint zone involves Ti2Cu IMCs. By increasing the holding time, Ti2Cu is decomposed, and finally, the joint consists of tiny Ti2Cu in α-Ti matrix. Shear tests indicated that the homogenized joint bonded at a prolonged time exhibits better mechanical properties than those at a prolonged low time. The minimum and maximum shear strength were achieved in the quantity of 175 and 384 MPa at 5 and 45 min, respectively. The hardest zone in the samples of 5 and 45 min was the reaction zone and the diffusion-affected zone (DAZ) of Ti-6Al-4V, respectively. By the increase in the holding time, the failure mode changed from cleavage to semi-cleavage, and the fracture path was altered from the reaction zone to the DAZ of Ti-6Al-4V zone, originating from the reduction of IMCs in the joint center.
Abstract: The passivation behavior of the α and β phases in a Ti-6Al-4V alloy under different oxygen conditions was investigated. The α and β phases exhibit a stronger tendency toward galvanic corrosion under deoxygenated conditions, but not under oxygenated conditions. From in situ scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM) method we find the α oxidation rate is higher. Meanwhile, the passive film composition and structure of α's and β's were compared by using FIB-STEM. The α phase has a lower Al/V element concentration and more atoms in the matrix to participate in the annihilation reaction of metal vacancies. Furthermore, based on first principles and statistical mechanics, the alloying element Al/V alters the Ti atoms coordination environment and reduces the Ti atoms adsorption potential.
Abstract: Underwater directed energy deposition (UDED) is a promising technology for on-site maintenance and repair of Ti–6Al–4V alloy. The microstructurally short fatigue crack initiation and growth behaviors of Ti–6Al–4V repaired by UDED were investigated through in-situ SEM fatigue testing. The results were compared with those of the Ti–6Al–4V repaired by in-air directed energy deposition (DED) and a substrate. The experimental results show that the microstructure of the Ti–6Al–4V repaired by UDED was dominated by α′ martensite. The α′ martensite in the Ti–6Al–4V repaired by in-air DED decomposed into α+β due to the intrinsic heat treatment. Both the strength and microhardness of the Ti–6Al–4V repaired by UDED were higher than those of the Ti–6Al–4V repaired by in-air DED. Compared with the Ti–6Al–4V repaired by in-air DED, the Ti–6Al–4V repaired by UDED presented a short micro crack initiation time and a poor fatigue crack propagation resistance. The short fatigue crack initiation and propagation behaviors of the as-deposited Ti–6Al–4V were primarily controlled by the structures and morphologies of the microstructures rather than the residual stresses. In addition, the prior-β boundaries in the Ti–6Al–4V repaired by UDED had a resistance effect on the fatigue crack growth rate. However, the resistant effect of prior-β boundaries in the Ti–6Al–4V repaired by in-air DED was not obvious and the local colony α+β played a dominant role in the resistance of short fatigue crack propagation.
Abstract: The deformation behavior of Ti-6Al-4V (at.%) wires under direct electric current was investigated. To minimize thermal effects due to Joule heating on plastic deformation, fine Ti-6Al-4V wires with 100 μm diameter were tested by developing and utilizing an innovative electro-thermo-mechanical tensile tester. The force-controlled tensile tester consists of an electronic balance, piezo actuator, optical camera, infrared thermometer, and electric power supply. To characterize the state of Joule heating in the fine wire, the temperatures at the wire and load frame junction were measured with a non-contact infrared thermometer and then a finite element analysis was conducted using the measured temperatures as boundary conditions. For validation of our experimental approach, we have carried out uniaxial tensile testing of Ti-6Al-4V wires under 0, 10, and 20 A/mm2 current densities, respectively, and the results were compared with previous reported values. In our specimen, the change of mechanical properties including the reduction of elastic modulus and strength and the increase of ductility and failure strain was observed with increasing the applied current. However, the level of change was not severe compared to other research. It could therefore be concluded that the thermal effect was minimized by using fine Ti-6Al-4V wires with a large surface-to-volume ratio. In the analysis of fracture surface, the transition from brittle to ductile fracture mode was clearly observed with increasing current density.
Abstract: Prior columnar β grains are an important microstructural feature of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) Ti-based alloys and affect the properties. The objective of this study was to reconstruct the prior β grains of heat-treated LPBF Ti-6Al-4V alloy using crystallography data of α grains from electron backscatter diffraction. The reconstruction shows that the orientation relationship in β to α transformation is close to the Burgers orientation relationship but not rational. Besides, the results clearly confirm the orientation inheritance between the reversed β phase and the prior β phase. An accidental finding is that the α boundaries, having with misorientation ranges of 15°–56° and 67°–88°, are nearly identical to the high-angle grain boundaries of prior β phase. This can be a simple approach to identify high-angle grain boundaries of prior β phase when reconstruction algorithm cannot be obtained.
Abstract: Ti-6Al-4V is a titanium alloy with excellent properties for lightweight applications and its production through Additive Manufacturing processes is attractive for different industrial sectors. In this work, the influence of mechanical properties on the notch fracture resistance of Ti-6Al-4V produced by Selective Laser Melting is numerically investigated. Literature data is used to inform material behaviour. The as-built brittle behaviour is compared to the enhanced ductile response after heat treatment (HT) and hot isostatic pressing (HIP) post-processes. A Phase Field framework is adopted to capture damage nucleation and propagation from two different notch geometries and a discussion on the influence of fracture energy and the characteristic length is carried out. In addition, the influence of oxygen uptake is analysed by reproducing non-inert atmospheres during HT and HIP, showing that oxygen shifts fracture to brittle failures due to the formation of an alpha case layer, especially for the V-notch geometry. Results show that a pure elastic behaviour can be assumed for the as-built SLM condition, whereas elastic-plastic phenomena must be modelled for specimens subjected to heat treatment or hot isostatic pressing. The present brittle Phase Field framework coupled with an elastic-plastic constitutive analysis is demonstrated to be a robust prediction tool for notch fracture after different post-processing routes.
Abstract: The ratcheting behaviour of the additively manufactured and thermo-mechanically treated Ti–6Al–4V alloy has been investigated. Post heat treatment microstructures of comparable mechanical strength properties have been developed from both the material. Additively manufactured Ti–6Al–4V has a heterogeneous microstructure with defects and residual stresses as compared to the homogeneous microstructure of thermo-mechanically treated Ti–6Al–4V. It has been found that the fatigue life of the as-built additively manufactured sample is less than 50% of the thermo-mechanically treated sample and the fatigue life decreases further after heat treatment. The macroscopic cyclic stress-strain behaviour could not be predicted well using the combined hardening model in the Finite Element Method for the additively manufactured alloy. This has been attributed to the heterogeneous evolution of microscopic strain investigated using the Digital image correlation (DIC) technique. The detrimental effect of heterogeneity of the microstructure on the ratcheting behaviour of the heat-treated additively manufactured alloy has been investigated using the Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique. It reveals that the presence of multi-variant needle-shaped martensite is effective in increasing the crack propagation resistance and increasing the fatigue life of the as-built additively manufactured alloy as compared to its heat-treated counterparts in which both lamellar and acicular morphology of alpha is prevalent.
Abstract: In the present scenario, wire additive manufacturing is the most effective and efficient technique adopted to realize complex and bulky components in aerospace applications. The current work mainly investigates the heterogeneous and anisotropic behavior of the electron bean wire additive manufactured Ti-6Al-4V. To investigate the effect of build orientation, cuboids were built to extract cylindrical samples with axis parallel to Z-axis, X-axis, Y-axis, and inclined at 45° to the base X-Y plane. Non-destructive inspection using radiography was conducted to ensure the attainment of defect-free samples. Further, the samples were subjected to advanced material characterization techniques. Microstructural features of as-built samples reveal the large columnar prior beta grains attributed to the rapid cooling in the vacuum chamber. Electron backscatter diffraction analysis shows β phase solidified as columnar grains. The martensite structure is observed in the Transmission electron microscopic analysis of the fabricated samples. The tensile samples build at different orientations exhibits the higher yield strength and higher percentage elongation for the sample built along Z-axis. The tensile strength and elongation of the additive built samples are found to be better than that of wrought Ti-6Al-4V. The fractography analysis on the fractured specimen reveals the failure through ductile mode.
Abstract: The effect of texture evolution, recrystallization behavior and deformation on the mechanical properties of cold rotary swaged Ti–6Al–4V tubing during annealing was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The prismatic slip (1 1(_) 00) [112(_) 0], pyramidal slip(10 1(_) 1) [1(_) 21(_) 0] with the largest Schmid factor values (SF) and {101(_) 2} twining structure can be obtained after annealing at 650 °C. The high plasticity of the Ti–6Al–4V tubing can be attributed to the combined effect of slip structure and twining structure. As a result, Ti–6Al–4V tubing has excellent tensile properties and achieves a compromise between strength and ductility. Meanwhile, the radial texture produced by cold rotary swaging has almost no change though slight recrystallization occurs at this temperature. After annealing at 750 °C, the content of {10 1(_) 2} twining decreases significantly, and the recrystallization reduces the dislocation and grain boundary strengthening effects. This work is of theoretical significance and practical value for optimizing the annealing processes of cold rotary swagged Ti–6Al–4V tubing and developing advanced aerospace hydraulic systems with higher operating pressures.
Abstract: The intrinsic high cooling rates and high thermal gradients of laser additive manufacturing leaded to a tendency towards columnar grains. Hybrid in situ point-mode forged and laser additive manufacturing (HFAM) was a newly-developed printing technique with the capability of full transition from columnar grains to fine equiaxed grains in the HFAM-processed samples. Press down volume (PDV) of point-mode forging, an important parameter in the HFAM technique, affected the microstructure of the HFAM-processed samples. The effects of PDVs on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the HFAM-processed Ti-6Al-4V were investigated. The HFAM-processed samples showed equiaxed grains. The grain sizes were decreased with the increase in the PDV. The higher PDV contributed to the generation of the equiaxed primary α-Ti phase. The microstructure with fine grains and a bimodal morphology was achieved via the PDV of 0.25 mm, providing excellent comprehensive mechanical properties. The tensile strength and elongation at break of 0.25 mm PDV sample were ∼20.6% and ∼115.1% higher than that of un-forged one.
Abstract: High temperature and severe deformation induced by the turning process of Ti-6Al-4V alloy will significantly impact the microstructure evolution of the chip and machined surface layer, thus significantly affecting the mechanical properties of the machined part. This study innovatively proposed a coupling simulation technology regarding finite element (FE) and cellular automata (CA) to simulate the microstructure evolution on macroscale and mesoscale, respectively, to improve the mechanical performance of the machined part. The modified Johnson and Cook (JC) constitutive model was used and its constitutive parameters were determined by combining an experimental method with an inverse identification methodology, to improve the precision of FE simulation. Based on the determined constitutive parameters, the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) models of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) were integrated into the FE model to investigate the distribution fields of grain size on macroscale. Afterward, the microstructure evolution on mesoscale was simulated successfully based on CA models of microstructure evolution and related input parameters obtained from the FE simulation. Orthogonal cutting experiments and corresponding tests adopting Electron Back Scattering Diffraction (EBSD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and metallographic microscope were performed to verify the credibility of FE and CA simulations. The results of the simulation and the experiments showed a reasonable consistency. The effects of cutting parameters on the grain size were analyzed through simulations and experiments. As indicated by the results, the degree of grain refinement occurring in the adiabatic shear band and machined surface layer increased with the increase in the cutting speed and the feed rate under the selected ranges of cutting parameters, whereas the effect mechanisms of the cutting speed and the feed rate were different, which could be conducive to selecting appropriate cutting parameters, so as to improve the mechanical properties of the machined part.
Abstract: The pressure reduction of transient liquid phase bonding (TLPB) technique with sound Ti–6Al–4V similar joint is reported. Eliminating brittle intermetallic compounds (microstructural homogenization) and voids at the interface (void closure) is critical for sound joints with bending strength above the yield strength of Ti–6Al–4V. These two goals are achieved by adjusting the holding time (0.5–12 h) and bonding pressure (0.001–0.3 MPa) at a fixed bonding temperature of 950 °C below the phase transus of the substrates. The maximum bending strength of 1570 MPa is obtained with joint having a homogenized microstructure without any voids under joining condition held for 12 h with 0.03 MPa corresponding to 3% of the conventional TLPB technique. The holding time for microstructural homogenization is reduced with 0.3 MPa bonding pressure by liquid push-off from the interface. Low-pressure TLPB is recommended for cost reduction and ensuring shape accuracy of complex geometry components.
Abstract: We report a method on high-efficiency preparation of isotropic Ti-6Al-4V fasteners with super high strength. The fabrication process contains repeated rolling, drawing, heading, and heat treatment. The yield strength (σ0.2) of present fastener material reaches ∼1100 MPa in both axial and radial directions, which is among the highest value of all the Ti alloy fastener materials reported in the literature. The isotropic high strength of present material results from the fine bimodal microstructure and reduced texture. Present method to process Ti-6Al-4V fastener is both cost-effective and readily scalable, and it is therefore expected to be conducive to industrial production.
Abstract: Recently, additive manufacturing (AM), being part of IR4.0, received great attention for the fabrication of customized implants with outstanding quality, which are used in hard tissue replacement. For an orthopedic application, the titanium alloy implants, especially those that use Ti-6Al-4V manufactured by selective laser melting (SLM), should facilitate maximum osteointegration between the implant and corresponding bone. However, the superior mechanical characteristics, poor surface integration, antibacterial performance, and readiness of SLM Ti-6Al-4V for use in advanced implants are still not comparable to those of anatomical bone. This review focused on the current issue of stress-shielding limitations in SLM Ti-6Al-4V owing to failures in load-bearing applications. The surface treatment and modification strategy that might improve the osseointegration of the implant were discussed. The corrosion resistance of SLM Ti-6Al-4V which could significantly affect antibacterial capability, improve cell adherence and apatite formation on the bone remodeling surface was also addressed. Finally, the current challenges, prospects and applications for SLM Ti-6Al-4V development were presented.
Abstract: It is well known that slight changes in selective laser melting (SLM) process parameters may alter the outcome of mechanical and physical properties of the as-built material in a drastic and haphazard fashion. To overcome this, reliable property prediction models are most pertinent. In this study, a machine learning approach based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is proposed to predict the relative density of as-built Ti-6Al-4V alloy manufactured via SLM, based on the most common input process parameters such as laser power, scanning speed, hatch spacing, and layer thickness, as well as an integrated input of volumetric energy density. A most comprehensive test dataset to train and verify GPR models was retrieved from literature papers that extensively investigated mechanical and physical properties of additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V alloy. GPR models with four different kernel functions were analyzed and exponential GPR model with optimized hyperparameters was chosen as the most viable model for predicting as-built density of Ti-6Al-4V alloy. A parametric multiple linear regression (MLR) model was also presented and serves as a benchmark. When inferences were made on newer publication data, the GPR model and the MLR model predicted the densities with mean absolute errors (MAE) of 1.12% and 5.22% respectively. The inferior performance of the MLR model compared emphasizes the need of non-parametric supervised learning technique for SLM. To truly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GPR model in real-world metal AM jobs, 22 experimental samples were printed. Predictions made on all the samples, when compared to their actual density values, resulted in MAE of 0.27%. Clearly, creation of most comprehensive mined data, kernel selection, and rigorous validation and verification of GPR model make this study one of its kind and prove the GPR model's predictive dexterity and the potential impact in the world of additive manufacturing.
Abstract: In this study, a new toxic-free Ti40Zr10Co36Pd14 amorphous alloy with a critical casting size of 5 mm diameter and 20 mm long has been synthesised through copper-mold casting process. The Ti40Zr10Co36Pd14 bulk metallic glass (BMG) rod has further formed into thin films through the filtered cathodic vacuum arc (FCVA) deposition process. To assess the biocompatibility and the surface behaviour of the synthesised Ti40Zr10Co36Pd14 BMG, the metallic glass (MG) thin films are fabricated on the glass substrate and cultured using murine osteoblast cells (MC3T3-E1) and human osteoblast-like cells (SaOS-2). Various characterisation techniques has been utilised to evaluate the surface properties and the cultured cells behaviour of the deposited thin films. The synthesised Ti40Zr10Co36Pd14 composition shows good biocompatibility similar to the routinely used Ti-6Al-4V. The osteoblast cells proliferate very well on the Ti40Zr10Co36Pd14 MGs and exhibit similar levels of alkaline phosphatase enzymatic activity to those of the controls and the Ti-6Al-4V material. The MC3T3-E1 cells adhered and spread faster on the alumina particle blasted Ti40Zr10Co36Pd14 and Ti-6Al-4V surfaces with osteoblast-like shapes. These results suggest that Ti40Zr10Co36Pd14 BMG is biocompatible and could support osteoblast differentiation. Thus, the new alloy can be used as a candidate material for potential biomedical application.
Abstract: A few-layered Ti3C2 MXene-coated Ti–6Al–4V composite powder was developed via powder surface modification by using fluidization technology. The obtained MXene coating demonstrated the advantages of uniform dispersion, high purity and good thermal stability. Also, the coating enabled the massive retention and uniform distribution of MXene in the sintered composite. Compared to the bare Ti–6Al–4V alloy, the yield strength of MXene/Ti–6Al–4V composite was increased from 895 to 1297 MPa, while maintaining the similar strain. The thermal conductivity of composite was approximately four-fold compared to that of Ti–6Al–4V alloy, which is attributed to the intrinsically high thermal conductivity and the uniform distribution characteristics of the remained Ti3C2 MXene in the composite.
Abstract: Large strain extrusion machining (LSEM) is a promising process to create chip foils with ultrafine grains and a certain type of crystallographic texture. Disclosing the interconnection between the deformation histories and the crystallographic texture variations resulting from the LSEM process is vital for the texture generation and control of Ti-6Al-4V chip foils. Electron-backscattered diffraction and viscoplastic self-consistent (VPSC) simulation were combined based on numerical simulation to study evolutions of crystallographic textures for chip foils during LSEM of Ti-6Al-4V. The deformation histories during LSEM process were also analyzed by coupling theoretical analysis with digital image correlation technique. The role of individual type of slip system on the texture variation of Ti-6Al-4V chip foils was identified by modifying the Voce hardening parameters in VPSC model. It is seen that strain path controlled by the chip thickness ratio changes the inclination of generated textures in chip foils. Basal and 1-st order pyramidal <c+a> slip systems are the main deformation modes in high strain rate deformation condition of LSEM process. Similar textures are formed under large strain and high strain rate deformation in LSEM comparing with that in free machining process. The conclusions are useful to control the crystallographic texture generation in LSEM of Ti-6Al-4V by optimizing cutting speeds and chip thickness ratios.
Abstract: X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as well as scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM/TEM) analysis was carried out on four Ti-6Al-4V powders used in electron beam powder-bed fusion (PBF-EB) production environments: virgin low oxygen (0.080 wt% O), reused medium oxygen (0.140 wt% O), reused high oxygen (0.186 wt% O), and virgin high oxygen (0.180 wt% O). The two objectives of this comparative analyses were to (1) investigate high oxygen containing Grade 23 Ti-6Al-4V powders which were further oxidized as a function of reuse and (2) comparing the two virgin Grade 23 and Grade 5 powders of similar oxygen content. The microstructure of the low oxygen virgin Grade 23 powder was consistent with martensitic α′ microstructure, whereas the reused powder displayed tempered α/β Widmänstatten microstructure. XPS revealed a decrease in TiO2 at the surface of the reused powders with an increase in Al2O3. This trend is energetically favorable at the temperatures and pressures in PBF-EB machines, and it is consistent with the thermodynamics of Al2O3 vs. TiO2 reactions. An unexpected amount of nitrogen was measured on the titanium powder, with a general increase in nitride on the surface of the particles as a function of reuse in the Grade 23 powder.11This work is an official contribution of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and is not subject to copyright in the United States.
Abstract: Changes in normal spectral emissivity during alloy oxidation cause large errors in radiation thermometry for aero-engines and gas turbines. To study the effect of oxidation on the normal spectral emissivity of the alloy surface, GH3044 alloy and Ti-6Al-4V alloy were selected as the research objects in this paper, and the normal spectral emissivity of the two alloys at 1.5–2.1 μm wavelength was experimentally measured during oxidation in the air for 12 h. The two alloys commonly showed an overall increasing trend with oscillation during the oxidation process, but their oscillation characteristics were significantly different. The interference effect caused by the air-oxide film interface was the main reason for the oscillation phenomenon. To explore the changes of normal spectral emissivity caused by oxide film, the composition and micromorphology of alloy surface were analyzed through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and it was found that the change of the alloy surface composition and micromorphology were the main factors for the overall increase on the normal spectral emissivity. In addition, polynomial models of normal spectral emissivity versus oxidation time of the two alloy was established, which was in good agreement with the experimental results.
Abstract: In this paper, a Ti-6Al-4V wall was fabricated using wire and arc additive manufacturing to be as-deposited (AD) coupons for investigating the effect of post-heat treatments on microstructure and mechanical properties. A Gleeble thermal-mechanical simulator was used to create a microstructure gradient in the sample with different heat treatment temperatures to efficiently determine the optimal post-treatment temperature, which is followed by furnace heat treatments to find proper aging (Age) conditions. Solid solution at 830 ℃ for 2 h followed by water cooling + aging at 500 ℃ for 4 h followed by furnace cooling was considered to be the optimal post-heat treatment candidate because it gained a 12.85% improvement of yield strength (YS) and 3.33% improvement of the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), though tensile fracture elongation (EL) decreased 3.37% compared to the as-deposited samples. With this condition, microstructure evolution including β grains, α widmanstätten, grain boundary α (GB α), and α’ martensite was characterized at the same position of the sample experienced deposition (AD), solid-solution treatment (AD-ST), and aging (AD-ST-Age) respectively. The relationship between such step-by-step microstructure evolution with tensile strength as well as hardness change was analyzed and established. In the end, brittle fracture surfaces of AD, AD-ST, and AD-ST-Age samples were observed to find the factors that contribute to failure.
Abstract: A novel two-step bonding of Ti-6Al-4V/Si3N4 joint was developed with Nb interlayer as residual-stress reliever via low-pressure transient-liquid-phase bonding (TLPB) of Ti-6Al-4V/Nb side prior to active-metal brazing of Nb/Si3N4 side. While 1.75 mass% of Ti in a 50-µm-thick CUSIL-ABA® filler was sufficient for sound bonding at Nb/Si3N4 side when brazed at 1103 K for 10 min, one-step-brazed joints with bonding area of 10 × 10 mm2 were prone to failure at the Ti-6Al-4V/Nb side due to brittle Cu-Ti intermetallic compounds (IMCs). Replacing brazing of Ti-6Al-4V/Nb side with TLPB using pure Cu and Ni foils as filler at 1213 K for 180 min eliminated the formation of brittle IMCs via homogenization of (α + β)-Ti; bending strength increased to 193 MPa with residual-stress-induced failure from Si3N4 ceramics. Finally, effectiveness of stress-accommodation via Nb interlayer and filler’s plastic flow was quantitatively verified with reasonable fidelity by finite-element analysis incorporating temperature-dependent elasto-plastic properties.
Abstract: Great efforts have been made in fabricating Ti–6Al–4V alloys that can be used in the biomedical implants industry. The increasing interest in using fabricated Ti–6Al–4V alloys in industrial applications is mainly due to the properties of alloys which include good combination of mechanical and corrosion resistance. This study was aimed at evaluating the corrosion properties of the Ti–6Al–4V alloy fabricated via powder rolling technique under various simulated human body solutions. A three-electrode electrochemical cell was used to carry out corrosion studies at 37 °C where the fabricated Ti–6Al–4V was immersed in 3.5% NaCl (pH = 6.5) and two simulated human body fluids, namely; Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) and Ringers solution with the measured pH of 6.9 and 6.4 respectively. The electrochemical techniques used to investigate the corrosion studies included open circuit potential (OCP), potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The fabricated Ti–6Al–4V alloy was characterized before and after the corrosion experiments via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The potentiodynamic polarization curves revealed a passivation phenomenon on the anodic domain indicating high corrosion resistance of Ti–6Al–4V alloy in all three electrolytes. The Ti–6Al–4V alloy exhibited the highest corrosion resistance when immersed in 3.5% NaCl with the estimated corrosion rate of 0.480 μm/yr. The excellent corrosion resistance of Ti–6Al–4V alloy was mainly due to the formation of an oxide film formed on the alloy surface as deduced from the EIS analysis. No corrosion products were detected by XRD analysis on the Ti–6Al–4V alloy surface immersed in all electrolytes which confirmed an excellent corrosion resistance property.
Abstract: Surface treatments are used to improve the tribological properties of titanium alloys for aeronautical applications. The present work aims to investigate the effect of a Cr/CrN multilayer coating on the surface integrity of Ti-6Al-4V alloy under fatigue loadings. SEM, EDS and optical microscopy techniques were applied to characterize the coated surface. The surface integrity after axial fatigue tests of the coated titanium alloy was investigated through SEM of the fracture surfaces. The results showed that cracks nucleated in the brittle layers of CrN during the fatigue cycles and, consequently, reduced the fatigue performance of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy.
Abstract: Ti-6Al-4V alloy has been used for bone implant materials. The porous Ti-6Al-4V lowers the mechanical misfit and prevents the implant loosening between bone and metal implant. The influence of sintering parameters, i.e., heating rate, sintering temperature, pressure, space holder size, and its distribution to the formation of both micro and macro- porosity is investigated. The initially developed image analysis of samples was used to quantitatively analyze the influence of process control agent (PCA) on the distribution of macro-pores. From the SEM results and samples relative density, it is found that the main parameter to control in the solid-state space holder method is space holder distribution, sintering pressure, and sintering temperature. Additionally, the most effective condition to produce less micro-porosity and more interconnectivity between macro-pore is the utilization of 10 wt% ethanol as PCA and sintering at 700 °C, 60 MPa.
Abstract: Poor surface quality of Additively Manufactured (AM) components, can greatly increase the overall cost and lead time of high-performance components. Examples are medical devices where surfaces may contact the patient's skin and hence need to be smooth and aerospace components with high fatigue strength requirements where surface roughness could reduce fatigue life. The average surface roughness (Ra) of AM parts can reach high levels greater than 50 μm and maximum distance between the high peaks and the low valleys of more than 300 μm. As such, there is a need for fast, cost effective and selective finishing methods of AM produced components targeted at high-performance industries. In this paper Ti-6Al-4V Grade 23 ELI, popular for medical devices and aerospace parts production, was L-PBF processed to manufacture parts which were subsequently treated via laser polishing. Here in this work, CO2 laser polishing was used for the surface modification of the Ti-6Al-4V produced samples. The most significant processing parameters were optimised to achieve approximately an 80% reduction in the average surface roughness and a 90% reduction in the peak-to-valley distance with a processing time of 0.1 s/mm2 and cost of 0.2 €/cm2.
Abstract: The metastable pitting corrosion behavior of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) produced Ti-6Al-4V is still unclear. Therefore, this work investigated the metastable pitting corrosion of LPBF-produced Ti-6Al-4V in Hank’s solution by electrochemical methods. The LPBF-produced sample (dominant by α′ phase in the microstructure) shows a higher frequency of pit nucleation than the annealed counterpart (composed by α + β dual phase). The passive films formed on the LPBF-produced sample exhibit a higher flux of oxygen vacancies, resulting in the absorption of more aggressive ions (e.g., Cl-) thereby producing more cation vacancies. The condensation of excessive cation vacancies contributes to the pit nucleation.
Abstract: This study assessed the effect of co-substitution of strontium (Sr) and magnesium (Mg) ions into the hydroxyapatite (HA) coating which was deposited on Ti–6Al–4V dental alloys by an electrochemical deposition process. The deposited layers were examined using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The corrosion behavior of Ti–6Al–4V alloys in an artificial saliva environment was studied through potentiodynamic polarization technique and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results indicated that the substituted Sr and Mg ions in HA improved the HA coating, where the protection efficiency percentage (PE%) for Ti–6Al–4V alloys coated with Sr/Mg-HA was higher than for those coated with HA only. Maximum PE% was 74.19% for Ti–6Al–4V alloys coated with Sr/Mg-HA. Coating of the dental Ti–6Al–4V alloys with co-substituted bioactive Sr and Mg ions in HA improved the corrosion resistance properties of the alloys in the saliva environment.
Abstract: Electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF) has been given much attention in recent years for its potential in the aerospace and medical industries, particularly with Ti-6Al-4V. However, these processes produce parts with inherent rough surface finishes, impacting the performance and generating additional challenges and costs with surface post-processing. This review examines the primary mechanisms responsible for surface roughness generation in EB-PBF and the process variables that have been verified to influence the surface quality of Ti-6Al-4V parts. The challenges in surface metrology of metallic PBF parts are also discussed, as are new perspectives and guidelines for future research.
Abstract: The trade-off between strength and toughness has always been a key problem hindering the application prospect of titanium alloys. In this study, Ti–6Al–4V titanium alloy was processed by cryorolling combined with short-period vacuum annealing to overcome the problem. Results show that after annealing at 973 K, its yield strength and ultimate tensile strength were as high as 1020 MPa and 1126 MPa, respectively, and the elongation reached 10.9%. The static toughness of Ti–6Al–4V titanium alloy reached more than 12,000 MPa·%, which is the highest value compared with the rolled other kinds of titanium alloys reported in recent years. During short-period annealing of cryorolled Ti–6Al–4V sheets, the pinning effect of fine β phase particles and the competition mechanism between α and β grains inhibited the coarsening of grains. Meanwhile, partial recrystallization and recovery make the combination of micro-grains and ultrafine-grains. The shear band structure was weakened after annealing, which provides more favorable conditions for homogeneous deformation before fracture, which contributed to the enhanced toughness. The methods adopted here are suitable for large-scale industrial manufacturing the high strength and toughness Ti–6Al–4V alloys and might be applied to other kinds of Ti alloys.
Abstract: Ti–6Al–4V (TC4) alloy was treated by wet shot peening (WP) using ceramic beads compared with dry shot peening (SP). The effects of shot peening on surface integrity, microstructural evolution, fatigue crack initiation behavior and tensile-tensile fatigue performance were investigated applying multiple characterization techniques. The result exhibited that the surface plastic deformation caused by WP and SP treatment resulted in microstructure changes near the surface. Surface morphology was distinctly changed by shot peening treatment. The roughness value increased from 0.596 μm (Ra) to 1.594 μm (Ra). Microhardness gradients and compressive residual stress (CRS) distributions along the depth were induced by shot peening. The maximum hardness reached 373.5 HV, 407.8 HV and 445.3 HV. The maximum value of CRS reached 884 MPa, 1038 MPa and 1207 MPa with the corresponding depth at 21 μm, 25 μm and 40 μm. The fatigue life was significantly improved by shot peening treatment. Cracks tended to initiate at the subsurface layer instead of the treated surface after shot peening. The reason for crack initiation position altering was tentatively explained by the CRS stable zone. The competition mechanism between the surface stress concentration and local strengthening factors were discussed based on the analysis of stress concentration factor, Kt.
Abstract: Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy is a typical difficult-to-cut material used in many fields. The selection of cutting parameters exerts tremendous influences on the material removal process. Finite element numerical simulation is a low-cost method to obtain optimized cutting parameters. Finite element simulation requires the study of machining properties of machined materials. The material removal and related physical phenomena during machining are characterized by the dynamic mechanical properties of the machined material. In this paper, the dynamic mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4V have been tested by the high temperature split Hopkinson pressure bar system to obtain true stress–strain curves under different conditions. The sensitivity of strain and temperature of Ti-6Al-4V has been analyzed. The influence of temperature-dependent specific heat capacity, which has been tested by a laser thermal conductivity tester, on adiabatic temperature rise has been considered. Adiabatic temperature rise has been calculated separately with constant specific heat capacity and temperature-dependent specific heat capacity. True stress–strain curves have been switched to true stress–strain isothermal curves to analyze separately the influence of strain rate and temperature on true stress. Based on true stress–strain isothermal curves, the constitutive models of power-law and Johnson–Cook have been introduced to fit the experimental results. The fitting results of the two constitutive models have been compared with the experiment results, which have an average error less than 6%.
Abstract: The joining of light alloy and carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics composite (CFRTP) is recently considered to be an effective way to meet the lightweight requirements of components manufacturing in the aviation field. Furthermore, laser joining technology presents an innovative method for joining CFRTP and light alloy with the advantage of high precision, high efficiency and non-contact. In this paper, a thermo-mechanically coupled model for laser wobble joining of CFRTP and Ti-6Al-4V alloy has been established with the combined heat source, which has not been comprehensively studied in the published research. The typical features of the temperature field and the distribution characteristic of the residual stress are analyzed thoroughly under various parameters, whereas the optimized process parameters are attained in terms of the size of the resin melting zone (RMZ) at the interface as well as the maximum value of residual stress. In addition, a validation experiment was implemented to substantiate the established model. The results indicate that the size of RMZ at the interface enlarges appreciably with higher laser power and lower scanning speed. The distinct residual stress concentration around the weld and the asymmetric residual stress concentration inside the CFRTP can be principally interpreted with the comprehensive effect of non-uniform heat input and fixture constraints during the laser joining process. Moreover, according to the size of RMZ as well as the maximum value of residual stress, the optimum parameters are eventually determined as scanning speed of 0.015 m/s and laser power of 2000 W. The simulated result presents substantial consistency with the verification experimental result, therefore corroborating the validity and accuracy of the established model.
Abstract: Ti–6Al–4V alloy manufactured by selective electron beam melting (SEBM) was heat treated with solution treatment at 1020°C for 2 h and aging at 500°C for 8 h, and the as-printed and heat-treated samples were shock loaded with split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) at different strain rate (1700 s-1and 2700 s-1) and loading directions. The effects of microstructure, phase composition and orientation on adiabatic shear behavior were discussed. The results showed that the adiabatic shear behavior of as-printed Ti–6Al–4V was anisotropic, the differences of critical strain for adiabatic shearing between as-printed longitudinal and radial simples are 0.025 at 1700 s-1 and 0.004 at 2700 s-1 respectively; however, the differences of critical strain decrease to 0.002 at 1700 s-1 and 0.001 at 2700 s-1 after heat treatment, which indicate the heat treatment significantly decrease the anisotropy. The as-printed longitudinal samples with the were more prone to adiabatic shearing than the radial samples, due to the great influence of the orientation of α phase cells on adiabatic shear susceptibility. For example, when the c-axis of α phase cells was parallel to the loading direction, i.e., the as-printed longitudinal sample, it was difficult to active the basal{0001} < 11 2‾ 0 > and prismatic{101‾ 0} < 112‾ 0 > slip systems during shearing and only the pyramidal{101‾ 1} < 112‾ 0 > slip system with higher critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) could be activated, which increased the flow stress and enhances the thermal softening effect, and resulting in a higher adiabatic shear susceptibility of the as-printed longitudinal samples. The adiabatic shear susceptibility of the heat-treated samples in the longitudinal and radial directions was similar, because the orientation of the microstructure became weaker after recrystallization. The heat-treated samples were more susceptible to adiabatic shearing, because the lamellar spacing was reduced and the aspect ratio of the lamellar α phase became larger, which resulted in a larger α-phase interface area compared to that of the as-printed sample, causing greater resistance for dislocation moving during deformation, so the flow stress was elevated and the corresponding thermal softening effect was enhanced, which eventually led to an increase in adiabatic shear susceptibility.
Abstract: This work investigates the mechanism of the controllable wettability transition on laser ablated Ti-6Al-4V alloy surfaces with the vacuum treatment. The effects of surface morphologies, vacuum conditions and joint mechanisms are discussed. To achieve stable and controllable wettability transitions, the laser ablated Ti-6Al-4V alloy surfaces were placed in a low vacuum environment to adsorb non-polar organic molecules. The sample appeared an unstable wettability transition, which manifested itself as a change in the apparent contact angle (ACA) with time. High vacuum conditions can accelerate the assembly of organic molecules on the sample surface and achieve a stable wettability transition. Furthermore, by varying the surface morphologies of laser ablated Ti-6Al-4V alloy and the adsorption time of organic molecules, stable and controllable wettability transitions can be achieved at high vacuum conditions.
Abstract: This research studies the directed-energy deposition of Ti-6Al-4V (wt%) in an argon atmosphere containing 9–9500 ppm oxygen (from air), using both fresh and recycled feedstock powders. For fresh powder builds, when exposed to a 3500 ppm oxygen-containing atmosphere, a yield strength (YS) of 1061 ± 0.6 MPa and an elongation-to-fracture (ETF) of 10.5 ± 1.6 % are obtained. The oxygen pickup in the build deposit tends to plateau at 1000 ppm beyond 3500 ppm oxygen exposure. Conversely, the nitrogen pickup shows an increasing trend, reaching 1000 ppm for the air exposure range investigated. Recycled powder builds are stronger but less ductile than equivalent fresh powder builds made under comparable atmospheres. A higher degree of interstitial element pickup with no apparent saturation is identified for builds made from recycled powders, due to their smaller average particle size and a correspondingly larger specific surface area. The resulting microstructure for all samples made with air exposure comprises full lamellar α + β, formed through the in-situ decomposition of martensite at a temperature close to 600 °C. This conclusion is supported by the β volume fraction at 600°C as predicted by Thermo-Calc agreeing with image analysis data. The α lath thickness is found to increase with air exposure level. The increased β-transus temperature and martensite start temperature, and the accelerated diffusion-driven phase transformation due to the presence of elevated interstitial element contents accounts for the α lath thickening behaviour. YS and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) are found to increase linearly with oxygen equivalent. Solid solution strengthening from nitrogen and oxygen pickup is responsible for this increase. YS and UTS models based on oxygen equivalent are proposed. Nitrogen and oxygen in the builds dictate the ETF, with nitrogen content being the more potent factor.
Abstract: Surface modification of the implant surface via silver ion (Ag+) implantation shows promise in reducing the post-surgery infection rates. Silver was ion implanted into polished Ti-6Al-4V and the anodically oxidised Ti-6Al-4V surfaces at two implantation fluences, namely, 0.4 and 1.2 × 1017 ions/cm2. Anodic oxidation was carried out using the 0.5 M H2SO4 and 2.1 M H3PO4 electrolytes. This study aims to characterise the surfaces and to determine whether surface modification of Ti-6Al-4V via anodic oxidation improves the Ag+ release from the surfaces in vivo. The tested dosages had no appreciable effect on the final amount of stored silver for both studied TiO2 layers as supersaturation of the surface with silver occurs at low dosage. Ag+ release from the anodic TiO2 layers was independent of the electrolyte used to create the anodic layer. Polished Ti-6Al-4V surfaces showed a greater potential silver storage capacity relative to the anodic TiO2 samples since the concentration of silver stored at the surface was roughly proportional to the Ag+ dosage. Comparison of Ag+ release rates of all studied samples with literature to determine the potential antimicrobial effects showed that all studied conditions had the potential to be 100% antimicrobial.
Abstract: A tribo-layer, produced on parts made of titanium alloys fabricated using various machining techniques, is a natural outcome of these processes. Its removal, improving surface quality before nitriding, may seem not always justified as the latter treatment again causes surface roughening increasing with temperature. Therefore, the aim of the present paper was to investigate the surface integrity aspects of Ti–6Al–4V ELI alloy subjected to turning, i.e. presence of grooving and tribo-layer on the following gas nitriding process but performed at the low temperature of only 540 °C. Roughness and hardness measurements were supplemented by complementary microstructural investigations using SEM, TEM and XPS. These established that the coating of tribo-material on the as-machined alloy consists of oxidized amorphous layers with numerous thicker clumps. Nitriding at 540 °C, for 8 and 16 h, causes a gradual (from top to bottom) transformation of the tribo-layers into mostly crystalline TiO2 rutile phase. Completion of this stage makes the thinner part of tribo-layers permeable to nitrogen, starting nucleation and growth of TiN in the substrate. This process is accompanied by a release of nitrogen from the nitrided region and formation of a thin layer of α-Al2O3 in-between TiO2 rutile and TiN. This shows that efficient nitriding of machined titanium alloy parts, which produces an uniform TiN layer, should be achieved only after a full removal of the tribo-material from their surfaces.
Abstract: Directional thermal gradients, high cooling rates and stochastic powder-laser interactions during additive manufactured (AM) result in printed Ti alloys with anisotropic properties, high strength but reduced ductility. Harnessing the inherent AM defects and using a standardized thermomechanical process, the authors designed a Ti alloy with duplex microstructure that overcomes the strength-ductility trade off while reducing anisotropy. Here, we uncover the deformation mechanisms of the Ti-6Al-4V duplex microstructure consisting of defect-free globular α-grains and hierarchical α-laths. Evaluation of the tensile surface reveals that the deformation begins with the early saturation of work hardening in α-laths, followed by the emergence of interfacial back stress hardening, and finally the transfer of strains to globular α-grains. Plastic strains partaken by the globular α-grains prompt crystal rotations to “softer” orientations (basal, and prismatic) and generate a fine network of dislocation cells. These findings suggest the ability to push property limits of structural materials by microstructure engineering during AM.
Abstract: Based on low cycle fatigue (LCF) experiment data of SLM Ti-6Al-4V, a comprehensive finite element model of the combined isotropic and kinematic hardening and continuous damage for SLM Ti-6Al-4V is established. The simulation results of the stress-strain hysteresis loop and the LCF life are in good agreement with the experiment results under different strain amplitude levels. Based on the reliable achieved model of SLM Ti-6Al-4 V, the finite element model of the Gyroid and Diamond lattice structure is established for LCF analysis. It is found that the Diamond lattice structure has higher LCF resistance.
Abstract: To improve the corrosion resistance of Ti-6Al-4V alloy, a Ti-6Al-4V coating layer was deposited by the alternating current assisted gas tungsten arc welding (AC-GTAW) method. The effect of auxiliary alternating current on the microstructure and corrosion resistance of coating layers was investigated. The results show that the AC-GTAW coating layer has strong corrosion resistance due to α-widmanstatten colony structure. The oxides and hydroxides were formed on the coating layers surface after corrosion, and the microstructure and alloy element had a significant influence on the corrosion characteristic of the Ti-6Al-4V coating layers.
Abstract: A distinctive combustion phenomenon is revealed by promoted ignition combustion tests of Ti-25V-15Cr and Ti-6Al-4V alloys. The relationship between ignition temperatures and oxygen pressures obeys the Van't Hoff equation. The ignition temperatures of Ti-25V-15Cr are higher than that of Ti-6Al-4V due to the decomposition and volatilization of V2O5. However, the burning velocity of Ti-25V-15Cr is faster than that of Ti-6Al-4V, attributed to the different migration way of solid-liquid interface. The phase structure of the matrix is considered as the key factor that controls the spreading rate of the solid-liquid interface and the burning velocities of Ti-25V-15Cr and Ti-6Al-4V alloys.
Abstract: In this paper, the selective laser melting (SLM) Ti-6Al-4V sample with defects is heat treated (HT). The heat treatment temperatures are 750 °C, 850 °C, and 950 °C. The three temperatures are kept for 2 h, and then air cooling (AC) is used for treatment. Observe the changes in microstructure, phase composition, hardness, and tensile properties. The results show that the existence of defects will not affect the overall change trend of the microstructure, hardness and phase composition of the Ti-6Al-4V sample after heat treatment. However, there are obvious changes in the surrounding of two kinds of defects, which are the surface defects with large area and the lack of fusion (LOF) defects that are communicated with the outside world and extend to the inside of the sample. These two types of defects water, oil and air are easy to enter, and the defects are not easy to remove, heating will produce a large amount of hydrogen. Hydrogen enters the sample through defects, resulting in a large number of β phase around the two types of defects, and white around the defects. The hardness near the defect decreased significantly, and the closer the distance, the more the hardness decreased. A large amount of hydrogen entered into the Ti-6Al-4V sample, resulting in the appearance of new phase δ phase in the phase composition, resulting in the decrease of tensile strength（TS）and yield strength (YS) of the tensile properties after heat treatment, and the obvious decrease of elongation (EL). Moreover, among the various defects, the most important influence on the phase composition and tensile properties is the LOF defect that communicates with the outside world and extends to the inside of the sample.
Abstract: Medical grade Ti–6Al–4V implants fabricated using selective laser melting (SLM) are recognized as a commercial biomaterial used for bone repairs and fracture fixation. However, there have been cases of failed bone remodeling and implant infections caused by deficient osteointegration. To improve osteogenesis, the Ti implants are treated by acid-etching. This study focused on the effect of surface treatment by using different percentages of sulfuric acid (H2SO4), hydrochloric acid (HCL), and hydrofluoric acid (HF) on the SLM Ti–6Al–4V. The microstructure and surface topography before and after treatment were evaluated. Then, the presence of a thicker anatase layer that was detectable on the surface was also observed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The apatite-forming capabilities which indicated a sample bioactivity were assessed in simulated body fluid (SBF) for periods of 3 days and 7 days. The apatite formed on the surface of sample and XRD scanning revealed the deposition of Ca/P, suggesting successful bone-like apatite. The study discovered that these surface improvements were appropriate for the SLM Ti–6Al–4V prior to clinical applications and were likely to yield higher levels of osseointegration.
Abstract: This work studies the open hole surface integrity of Al 2024-T3/Ti-6Al-4V stacks, which have been subjected to different hole making methods, namely, conventional drilling and helical milling. The resulting hole-exit burr, surface roughness and machined surface/sub-surface microstructures have been characterized and the impact of the hole surface integrity on the fatigue performance of the machined coupons has been revealed. Results show that helical milling can effectively reduce burr formation at hole-exit and cause minimal sub-surface microstructural deformation, especially in the Ti layer. Helical milling produced holes with greater surface roughness, interestingly, the fatigue life of the helical milling coupons doubled that of conventional drilling.
Abstract: Hydride-dehydride (HDH) Ti-6Al-4V powders with non-spherical particle morphology are typically not used in laser-beam powder bed fusion (LB-PBF). Here, HDH powders with two size distributions of 50–120 µm (fine) and 75–175 µm (coarse) are compared for flowability, packing density, and resultant density of the LB-PBF manufactured parts. It is shown that a suitable laser power-velocity-hatch spacing combination can result in part production with a relative density of > 99.5% in LB-PBF of HDH Ti-6Al-4V powder. Size, morphology, and spatial distribution of pores are analyzed in 2D. The boundaries of the lack-of-fusion and keyhole porosity formation regimes are assessed and results showed parts with a relative density of > 99.5% could be LPBF processed at a build rate of 1.5–2 times of the nominal production rates in LPBF machines. The synchrotron x-ray high-speed imaging reveals the laser-powder interaction and potential porosity formation mechanism associated with HDH powder. It is found that lower powder packing density of coarse powder and high keyhole fluctuation result in higher fractions of porosity within builds during the LB-PBF process.
Abstract: This study focuses on the functionalized modification of Ti-6Al-4V and CoCrMo alloys substrates widely used by the biomedical domain as total joint replacements (TJRs) of the hip and knee. To improve the corrosion resistance of these devices, nanostructured columnar zirconium (Zr) thin films were produced by oblique angle deposition (OAD) using DC magnetron sputtering to model the particular design of the joint. The influence of the angular distribution of the incoming particle flux on the resulting film morphology (column tilt angle, porosity) and electrochemical behavior was studied by varying the substrates inclination angle θ from 15 to 90°. The experimental deposition process was reproduced by kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) models. With the increase of the flux incidence angle α from 0 to 70°, the film thickness and the column tilt angle β vary in agreement with the theoretical models. Additionally, the corrosion behavior of uncoated and Zr-coated alloys (CoCrMo and Ti-6Al-4V) was compared through open circuit potential chronopotentiometry and electrochemical polarization test in NaCl 0.9% solution at 37 °C. It was found that the corrosion protection was successfully improved by the presence of the films. The variation of the corrosion behavior with the flux incidence angle is explained by the changes in the film density.
Abstract: Temporary hydrogen alloying (THA) treatment was used to refine the coarse-grained microstructure of a Ti-6Al-4V alloy with the intention of modifying tensile strength and ductility. Microstructure evolution was characterised using X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results indicate that THA treatment does not refine the coarse network of prior beta grains, but it alters the coarse Widmanstätten microstructure by nucleating submicron beta grains within the individual lamellae. The modified microstructure increases ultimate tensile strength (UTS) in the order of 100 MPa. The dehydrogenation temperature affected tensile ductility. The lowest dehydrogenation temperature (675 °C) had the highest ductility loss, and increasing the dehydrogenation temperature recovered ductility until full ductility was recovered at 750 °C. The ductility loss was attributed to the embrittling effect of the hydrogen induced phase Ti3Al which remains in the microstructure even after hydrogen removal and only completely dissolves at 750 °C. The results demonstrate that THA treatment significantly alters the initial coarse-grained microstructure with concomitant improvement in strength, but that the promotion of Ti3Al precipitation can cause embrittlement unless the dehydrogenation treatment is controlled to optimise Ti3Al dissolution.
Abstract: Titanium alloys such as Ti-6Al-4V offer a potential lightweight alternative to traditional armour steels for ballistic protection due to their reduced density of approximately 60 % that of steel and tensile properties better than rolled homogenous armour steel. The manufacture of metallic armour often requires substantial thermomechanical processing to meet necessary ballistic performance specifications and thus restricts the complexity of armour designs. Additive manufacturing of Ti-6Al-4V has matured significantly in recent years, achieving outstanding mechanical properties in the as-built condition. In this study, Ti-6Al-4V plates were additively manufactured using both laser powder bed fusion and direct laser metal deposition for ballistic testing. The plates were built in different orientations and subjected to pre-heating or post heat-treatment to investigate the microstructural effect on the ballistic velocity limit (V50). The results show that plates with lamellar microstructure formed through martensite decomposition had higher V50 compared to lamellar microstructure formed via slow cooling through the β-transus. The post heat-treatment increased the V50 due to coarsening of the α-lath and stress relief. It is also apparent that anisotropy of the microstructure, specifically the columnar prior-β grains, affects the ballistic performance. A higher V50 was achieved when the columnar grains were aligned perpendicular to the projectile impact direction.
Abstract: Ti–6Al–4V is the largest useable titanium grade alloy in various engineering components due to its superior inherent properties like high strength to weight ratio, highly corrosive resistance, ability to withstand high temperature, etc. But machining of this alloy is found to be challenging because of having lesser thermal conductivity, highly chemical sensible, more sensitivity in work hardening and low young's modulus. However, the current study offers the use of novel and environment pleasant lubricants like iron aluminium oil with minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) concept to machine this alloy using a low budget hard tool (uncoated carbide) and the performance was compared with dry machining. Severe abrasion, adhesion, diffusion, and chipping were the main cause of tool failure in both cooling strategies. The tool life in MQL was traced to be 280% greater than the dry condition at the same turning parameters. Compared to dry turning, lower tool vibration and superior surface quality were obtained in MQL. The MQL assisted turning exhibited 12.38% lower costs than dry. Overall, with the use of an uncoated carbide tool, the turning of Ti–6Al–4V alloy in MQL was found to be more precise and more economical than dry and recommended for mass production works.
Abstract: In Part 2 of this paper series, high-throughput tensile testing and characterization of porosity, microstructure, and oxygen content was carried out on Ti–6Al–4V samples that were fabricated via electron beam powder-bed fusion (PBF-EB) to test our hypothesis that current industrial powder mixing strategies lead to stochastic chemistry content and tensile property variation throughout a given build. Fifteen rectangular blocks were built at locations across the entire build plate and machined into high-throughput tensile racks that contained 25 mini tensile coupons each (375 total specimens). There was a spread of 138.9 MPa in yield strength (YS) across all specimens. Considering the YS spread was only 74.2 MPa for a virgin build with no mixing, as detailed in Part 1, the difference between these two YS ranges is expected to be attributed to mixing. To determine the cause for this observed spread in YS, systematic investigation of porosity, microstructure, and oxygen content was performed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), micro X-ray computed tomography (μXCT), inert gas fusion, and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). The large variation in YS for these specimens could not be attributed to internal porosity, fracture surface porosity, α-lath thickness, or crystallographic texture. Inert gas fusion measurements indicated large, stochastic variation in oxygen content, and measurements via ToF-SIMS near the fracture surfaces indicate localized chemistry variations that could be responsible for the large variations in tensile properties, specifically the yield strength. Specific alternative powder mixing and reuse methodologies are proposed to mitigate undesirable chemistry and tensile property variation within PBF-EB Ti–6Al–4V.
Abstract: A new Ru-Ni-Nb combined cathode modification for Ti-6Al-4V alloy was investigated. There was a multiple blocking mechanism existed in the passivation film of Ru-Ni-Nb modified Ti-6Al-4V alloy, which not only increased the surface potential, but also greatly decreased the number of metastable oxides and point defects in the passive film, and reduced the transport and diffusion process of titanium ions and/or oxygen in the passive film, thus effectively reducing destruction of the passive film and maintaining the stability and integrity of the oxide film, which has excellent corrosion resistance in harsh oil &gas exploration environments.
Abstract: Ti and its alloys, especially Ti–6Al–4V, are ideal materials for many engineering applications but their wear resistance is generally poor. Literature suggests that TiB is the most promising reinforcement to create Ti-based composites with enhanced wear resistance. In this study, TiB-reinforced Ti–6Al–4V composites with B content of 0, 0.5 and 1 wt% were manufactured via flashless hot forging without and with subsequent solution plus aging heat treatments. From the analysis of the microstructure and mechanical behaviour of the TiB-reinforced Ti–6Al–4V composites, it is found that flashless hot forging in the β phase region seals the residual porosity achieving fully dense materials. The presence of B influences the mechanical behaviour and a more significant strengthening is found for an addition rate of 1 wt% rather than 0.5 wt%. The initial post-forging solution plus aging heat treatment changes the morphology of the microstructural features and, therefore, enhances the mechanical properties whereas the increment of the aging time has lower effect but controls the thermally-activated growth of the TiB particles.
Abstract: Damage-tolerant models for fatigue life estimation rely on fracture mechanics principles to model fatigue crack initiation and growth. In Laser-Based Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) produced Ti-6Al-4V defect populations present non-uniform in size, shape, and location within components. Considering defect populations in a statistical nature offers one method to characterise defects to be included in fatigue life modelling for AM parts. In this study a novel numerical fatigue life model is built upon which the sensitivity to input parameters, short crack growth mechanics, defect morphology and location for LPBF-produced Ti-6Al-4V is established. Furthermore, we introduce the potential for multiple crack initiation sites and crack interaction. Fatigue strength is shown to be more sensitive to selected threshold parameters and short crack growth mechanics. Furthermore, the introduction of multiple crack initiations and interaction results in distributions of fatigue strength estimates sensitive to defect number, illustrating the importance of its inclusion as a source of fatigue scatter in LPBF produced Ti-6Al-4V parts. Overall, this study establishes areas of nuance and criticality required in the design and modelling of fatigue life unique to AM produced components.
Abstract: The present study explores the near atomic scale spatial distributions of substitutional alloying elements (aluminium and vanadium) and interstitial impurities (oxygen and carbon) in the microstructures of Ti-6Al-4V and its boron modified counterpart (Ti-6Al-4V-0.1B) alloys using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe tomography (APT) techniques. The latter alloy possesses zero solubility of boron in α-Ti and high oxygen concentration around TiB particles. The results suggest that aluminium and vanadium atoms enrich α and β phases, respectively due to strong elemental partitioning between these phases, to an extent that the atomic scale concentrations of various elements considerably differ from the bulk compositions of the two alloys. Furthermore, oxygen atoms are preferentially distributed within the α phase where other interstitial impurities (carbon) also segregate. Substitutional aluminium atoms share an inverse interrelation with interstitial oxygen atoms while vanadium atoms reside besides the impurity-rich regions for both the alloys. The size differences for these elements (substitutional vs. interstitial) with host titanium atoms and related lattice distortion is (partially) held responsible for the atomic scale elemental distributions and the observed interrelations within the α phase. These arguments are further substantiated from DFT results previously obtained for Ti-6Al-4V alloy.
Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM) techniques have been rapidly expanding due to their ability to produce complex geometries with an efficient material use. However one of the main drawback of AM technologies is the poor surface quality especially for what concerns powder based techniques. In order to design reliable AM parts, the material mechanical properties resulting from the manufacturing process need to be properly characterized. The present study investigates the fatigue of miniaturized Ti-6Al-4V specimens manufactured using laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) along three different building orientations. In order to improve the surface quality, two post-treatments were applied to the test coupons, i.e. electro-plasma polishing and machining. Fatigue test results highlight how the post-treatments improve the fatigue properties of L-PBF Ti-6Al-4V samples with machined samples outperforming all the others conditions. Data gathered from the experimental campaign have been used to generate a predictive tool to account for surface quality, that can be used to foresee fatigue properties of Ti-6Al-4V samples subjected to different surface treatments.
Abstract: Developing high-strength welded joint of heavy-thick titanium alloy plates is in immediate need to unravel the strength-enhanced behaviors for high-pressure and low-temperature performance of deep-sea submersibles. Here, we synergistically employed transmission electron microscope (TEM) and electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) technologies to micro-crystallographically unravel the evolution behaviors of weld microstructure, grain orientation and grain boundaries for the welded joint of the heavy-thick Ti-6Al-4V plates with the thickness of up to 60 mm. Resulted, the strength-enhanced welded joint was evidently ascribed to the transformation of lath martensite into basketweave-martensite and the rigid-flexible mixture strategy of the enhanced conical-texture and the weakened basal-texture and cylindrical-texture. Furthermore, the remarkably lowered geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) density and the greatly decreased deformation-prone grains number due to the transformation of low-into-high angle grain boundaries indispensably strengthened the joint strength. Therefore, this work has made clear the strength-enhanced behaviors of Ti-6Al-4V welded joints for substantially improving high-strength welded structure of heavy-thick titanium alloy plates, and sufficiently promoting the service safety for deep-sea submersibles.
Abstract: Ceramics and metal joinings have been widely employed in aerospace, dental implants, and the electronic packaging industry for fabricating multifunctional components. In this study, the 35Bi2O3-50B2O3-15ZnO (mol.%) glass has been employed for joining the ZrO2 ceramic and Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The effect of brazing temperature on the microstructure evolution, mechanical properties, and bonding mechanism of brazed joints has been analyzed. The microstructure of the ZrO2/glass/Ti-6Al-4V joints and the content of Bi4B2O9, Bi2O3 and Bi24B2O39 precipitated crystals in glass were found to be dependent on the brazing temperature. The reaction product of Bi4Ti3O12 was identified in the glass/Ti-6Al-4V interface because of the chemical reaction between the oxidized layer of Ti-6Al-4V alloy and glass. A maximum shear strength as high as 48.8 ± 5.2 MPa was obtained. Our work, thus, demonstrates that the 35Bi2O3-50B2O3-15ZnO glass is an effective bonding material for joining ZrO2 ceramic and Ti-6Al-4V alloy under low temperature in an ambient atmosphere.
Abstract: Due to the stringent certification requirements and complex engine operating environment, the design of AM components for aero-engine application remains a challenging task. The high cycle fatigue performance of a weight-optimised bracket made using the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process was studied through shaker table testing. The results are discussed together with the observed mechanical and fatigue strengths in conjunction with material characterisation of microstructure, surface roughness, defects, micro-hardness and fracture surfaces. The debits in mechanical and fatigue strengths are expected due to process dependent surface roughness and the density of defects present. From the shaker table test results, it was concluded that the proposed weight-optimised LPBF bracket is capable of meeting the performance targets. The fundamental vibration mode of the bracket assembly was 84 Hz, which was much higher than the 1st Low Pressure shaft speed (48 Hz) of the target engine and thus avoids potential resonance. The bracket achieved its target inertial g load capability of 20 g and it was demonstrated that the bracket had enough redundancy in its load transfer paths should a strut fail during service of the engine. Lack of fusion voids and micro-cracks present on or near the surface were the prime sites for crack initiation. It has been shown that the as-built surface can cause a significant reduction (up to 40%) in the fatigue strength when compared to machined Ti-6Al-4V. A safe life regime for LPBF component design has been presented based on the Kitagawa-Takahasi diagram, modified using the Chapetti curve, which effectively links the material fatigue properties and performance of LPBF parts with intrinsic defects.
Abstract: This work studied the feasibility of an electron beam melting (EBM) Ti-6Al-4V alloy as a biomaterial for implants. Comparisons were made with a wrought forged Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The objective of this work was a detailed description of the microstructural and surface roughness effects on mechanical, electrochemical, and in-vivo biological performances. The EBMed condition showed higher mechanical properties, as well as higher electrochemical and ion release rates. These results were mainly influenced by the lamellar grain morphology and complex crystallographic texture of the EBMed alloy compared to the forged one. The higher area average roughness of the EBMed condition boosted the adhesion, proliferation, and biofilm formation of osteosarcoma (MG63), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The mechanical, ion release, corrosion, and in-vivo biological results in both studied conditions met the requirements for orthopedic and dental biomaterials. However, the forged condition is more recommended for patients with clinic stories related to S. epidermidis and S. aureus illnesses.
Abstract: In this study, 0.5 wt% Ni-P@GNF/ Ti-6Al-4V composites with different particle sizes (0–25, 15–53 and 53–150 μm) were fabricated via chemical nickel plating and speak plasma sintering. The plasma sintering temperature and the sintering pressure were 900 °C and 50 MPa, respectively. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the three composites were investigated via optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and compression experiments. The results showed that the microstructures of the composites were refined, and the compressive strength of the Ti-6Al-4V incorporated with graphene nanosheets was higher than that of the pure Ti-6Al-4V. Herein, with 0–25 μm Ti-6Al-4V powder, the compressive strength of 0.5 wt% Ni-P@GNFs/TC4 composite reaches 1339 MPa, which was an increase of 37.91% versus Ti-6Al-4V alloy (970 MPa). Moreover, with increasing spherical powder particle size, the size of the reinforcing phase of the network structure was coarser, and the plasticity was improved.
Abstract: In vivo retrievals of metallic orthopedic implants have shown selective dissolution of Ti-6Al-4V, where the vanadium-rich β phase preferentially corrodes from the surface. This damage, typically observed in crevices, is not directly caused by wear mechanics and the underlying electrochemical mechanism remains poorly understood. Previous studies show that fretting corrosion can cause negative potential drops, resulting in a decrease in surface oxide passivation resistance and the electrochemical generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at metallic surfaces. In this study, we combine cathodic activation and hydrogen peroxide to induce selective dissolution in vitro. After a 600 s -1 V hold and 4 h recovery in 20 °C 1 M H2O2 solution, the Ti-6Al-4V β phase was preferentially dissolved. An initial activation threshold of -0.5 V induced a significant increase in β dissolution (p = 0.000). Above this threshold, little selective dissolution occurred. In an Arrhenius-like fashion, decreasing solution concentration to 0.1 M required 72 h to generate β dissolution instead of 4 h at 1 M. Heating 0.1 M solution to body temperature (37 °C) resulted in a decrease in the time needed to replicate a similar level of β dissolution (>90%). Electrochemical impedance shows that both cathodic activation and inflammatory species are necessary to induce selective dissolution, where the combinatorial effect causes a significant drop in oxide passivation resistance from 106 to 102 (p = 0.000).
Abstract: Ti–6Al–4V alloys have been widely adopted because of their good mechanical properties. TIG welding is a common method for Ti–6Al–4V alloys. However, the high heat input of conventional TIG can lead to a coarsening of grains within Ti–6Al–4V and thus a weaker Ti–6Al–4V weld. This study presents a novel fast-frequency pulsed tungsten inert gas (FFP-TIG) welding technology to fabricate a high-reliability Ti–6Al–4V weld. The effects of fast-frequency pulsed waveforms on microstructures and mechanical properties of Ti–6Al–4V weld samples were uncovered. The arc core diameter of FFP-TIG technology was reduced by 32%–36% compared with that of conventional TIG. The adoption of FFP-TIG decreased the average grain sizes and acicular martensite α′ within the Ti–6Al–4V weld by 47.7% and 40.5%, respectively, which further enhanced the mechanical properties of the corresponding weldments. The hardness, tensile strength, and elongation of Ti–6Al–4V weldments obtained by FFP-TIG were improved by 10.35%, 13.84%, and 304.61% compared with those obtained by conventional TIG, achieving the highest value of 373 HV, 1018.97 MPa, and 4.301%, respectively. This study provides fresh insight into the development and application of high-reliability titanium alloy weldments commonly used in the aviation industry.
Abstract: This paper investigated the polishing of Ti-6Al-4V alloy by a novel pulsating cavitation air jet polishing (PCAJP) process. The principle of PCAJP is that the nozzle of the air jet and the workpiece are completely immersed in the prepared abrasive fluid with a certain concentration, and the pressurized air jet is spurted through the nozzle to drive the movement of the abrasive fluid near the workpiece. Due to the combined action of abrasive particles and microbubble cavitation effects, high material removal rate and surface quality can be obtained. In this paper, a PCAJP system was developed. The optimization of the main process parameters was carried out and the final roughness of Ti-6Al-4V specimens reached Ra 0.096 µm from the initial Ra 1.2 µm.
Abstract: In this work, rectangular blocks of electron beam powder-bed fusion (PBF-EB) additively manufactured (AM) Ti–6Al–4V were built, such that a total of 68 mini-tensile test coupons could be extracted for mechanical testing over a range of build height and build plate locations. These as-built tensile test coupons were uniaxially tested to fracture and subsequently studied via scanning electron microscopy, micro X-ray computed tomography, and inert gas fusion chemical analysis to systematically study the intra-build variations in tensile properties, microstructure, porosity, and chemistry. A strong correlation was observed between YS and build height, where YS was observed to decrease with increasing build height, up to 35 mm. There were no significant contributions to this variation in yield strength (YS) from build location, porosity, grain size, or crystallographic texture. Inert gas fusion oxygen measurements reveal the same trend, suggesting that oxygen content variation as a function of build height is contributing to the observed YS variation. The source of the oxygen content variation is thought to be a transient source of oxygen, such as moisture in the powder and build chamber. The establishment of this oxygen variation and its correlation to tensile properties motivates and facilitates improvements to PBF-EB Ti–6Al–4V processing, including powder mixing and handling.
Abstract: Additive technologies are actively implemented in various industries. The actual task is a complex study of the properties of the products. In the present work, electrochemical studies of the heat-treated Ti-6Al-4V alloy manufactured by Direct Energy Deposition were carried out to determine the evolution of electrochemical and mechanical properties. The analysis of the structure and phase composition were compared with the results of electrochemical and mechanical properties. The effect of the lamellae size and phase composition on corrosion and mechanical properties is more pronounced for the DED Ti-6Al-4V alloy. It was determined that the best electrochemical properties are possessed by a heat treated sample at 800 °C. With an increase the temperature of the heat treatment up to 900 °C, the corrosion resistance decreases, however, the values of relative elongation increase.
Abstract: Issues related to the machinability of hard-to-cut materials such as Titanium and Nickel base superalloy are well studied in past. This article attempts a comparative machinability study of Ti-6Al-4V and Nimonic-90 using conventional and ultrasonic-assisted turning . The ultrasonic-assisted and conventional turning for both the materials are performed under dry and sustainable cutting fluid , i.e., vegetable oil-based cutting fluid, keeping all the process parameters constant. Canola oil is used as vegetable oil. The machinability in terms of power consumption and tool life is analyzed. The ultrasonic-assisted turning under sustainable cutting fluid significantly reduces the power consumption and improves the tool life for both the materials. Comparing the machinability of both the materials, Ti-6Al-4V exhibits higher machinability than Nimonic-90. The sustainable cutting fluid leads to promote sustainability in the machining of Ti-6Al-4V and Nimonic-90.
Abstract: Titanium implants are widely used in traumatology and various orthopedic fields. Titanium and other metallic-based implants have limited structural and functional integration into the body, which translates into progressive prosthesis instability and the need for new surgical interventions that have enormous social and economic impacts. To enhance the biocompatibility of titanium implants, numerous biofunctionalization strategies have been developed. However, the problem persists, as more than 70% of implant failures are due to aseptic loosening. In this study we addressed the problem of improving the physiological engraftability and acceptability of titanium-based implants by applying a robust and versatile functionalization method based on the covalent immobilization of extracellular matrix (ECM)-derived oligopeptides on Ti-6Al-4V surfaces treated by activated vapor silanization (AVS). The feasibility of this technique was evaluated with two oligopeptides of different structures and compositions. These oligopeptides were immobilized on Ti-6Al-4V substrates by a combination of AVS and N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS) crosslinking chemistry. The immobilization was shown to be stable and resistant to chemical denaturing upon sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment. On Ti-6Al-4V surfaces both peptides increased the attachment, spreading, rearrangement and directional growth of mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MSC) with chondro- and osteo-regenerative capacities. We also found that this biofunctionalization method (AVS-EDC/NHS) increased the attachment capacity of an immortalized cell line of neural origin with poor adhesive properties, highlighting the versatility and robustness of this method in terms of potential oligopeptides that may be used, and cell lineages whose anchorage to the biomaterial may be enhanced. Collectively, this novel functionalization strategy can accelerate the development of advanced peptide-functionalized metallic surfaces, which, in combination with host or exogenously implanted stem cells, have the potential to positively affect the osteoregenerative and osteointegrative abilities of metallic-based prostheses.
Abstract: The fatigue behavior of SLMed Ti-6Al-4V has been intensively investigated in recent years. However, the effect of stress ratio has not been comprehensively studied, especially in VHCF regime. In this paper, the fatigue performance and crack initiation characteristics up to VHCF regime for an SLMed Ti-6Al-4V at various stress ratios (R = −1, −0.5, 0.1 and 0.5) were investigated and the effects of stress ratio were substantially discussed. The stress amplitude decreases with the increase of stress ratio with the order of: σa (R = −1) > σa (R = −0.5) > σa (R = 0.1) > σa (R = 0.5). Internal crack initiation is dominant in HCF and VHCF regimes under the four stress ratios, although surface crack initiation rarely occurs in HCF regime at R =  −1 and 0.5. Whether the crack initiates from subsurface or from interior is affected by the applied maximum stress, and the crack initiation is in relation not only to defect size but also to defect location. The nanograins in RA are evidently formed in VHCF regime at R = −1, −0.5 and 0.1, but not at R = 0.5, which is well explained by the NCP model.
Abstract: Ti–6Al–4V alloys prepared via electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF) generally exhibit a hierarchical microstructure consisting of columnar β-grains, an acicular α-matrix, and nanoscale β-precipitates at α-lath interfaces. In this study, we performed time-of-flight neutron diffraction measurements to investigate the texture and volume fraction of EB-PBF Ti–6Al–4V alloys via Rietveld texture analysis (RTA). The high-intensity neutron source enabled the analysis of the nanosized β-phase precipitates at the α-lath interfaces. The results indicate that the α- and β-textures of the as-built specimen can be ascribed to multiple Burgers orientation relationships among the prior β-phase, α-laths, and nanosized β-phase precipitates, which are not clearly understood. The as-built texture was maintained during post-processing, suggesting that texture manipulation in EB-PBF fabrication is important for controlling the crystallographic orientations of the built components, even after post-processing. RTA allowed a precise quantification of the β-phase fraction, which was found to have increased in post-processed specimens. The results would contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the microstructural evolution of such alloys, which is vital for the modeling and optimization of alloy performance.
Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies are gaining increasing attraction for biomedical applications due to the granted customizability and optimal surface topography for osteointegration. Ti-6Al-4V is one of the most promising materials due to its biocompatibility. However, excessive ions release can occur, leading to a relevant immunologic response in the surrounding tissues. Despite the corrosion behavior of the conventionally-manufactured material being well known, it should be assessed for AM-processed components, as the effect of the unique superficial and microstructural features granted by the process is still quite unknown. The aim of this paper is the electrochemical evaluation of the passive current density of the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF)-processed Ti-6Al-4V alloy via potentiostatic tests, carried out at typical in-service potentials for biomedical implants. This parameter is correlated with the ion release rate of the alloy, a fundamental phenomenon to address to prevent possible inflammations caused by the implant. Different manufacturing conditions (surface finishing, heat treatment) and exposure time (0, 60 and 6000 h) were considered. The importance of performing these measurements over a long period (> 8 months) was demonstrated. In fact, despite the initial current densities being significantly affected by the surface and microstructural differences, the ion release rates converged for long-time exposures. The results also underlined the good corrosion resistance of the material. Poor corrosion performances, alongside with significant current densities development, were observed in the as-built condition. A pickling treatment demonstrated to mitigate such effect without compromising the unique surface finishing granted by the manufacturing technology.
Abstract: This paper studies the deformation and fracture mechanism of Ti-6Al-4V titanium under high velocity (970 m/s and 1590 m/s) and hypervelocity (2240 m/s) impacts. For the Ti-6Al-4V target, as the impact velocity increases, the volume of the crater increases, and the shape of the crater gradually changes from a shallow dish shape to a hemispherical shape. After impact at 970 m/s, dislocation slip and twining occur in the crater, forming a large number of dislocation cells and {10-12} tensile twins; several adiabatic shear bands (ASBs) are formed in the crater, and the grains inside the ASBs are severely elongated with few microvoids. After impact at 1590 m/s, the overall deformation degree of the crater increases, in addition, {11-22} compression twins are formed in some deformed grains and recrystallization occurs in some ASBs. When the impact velocity reaches hypervelocity (2240 m/s), in addition to the deformation characteristic above, FCC twins and martensitic transformation also occur in the crater, and the number of ASBs increases significantly, many microvoids are generated and connected to form macrocracks in ASBs; meanwhile, a few spallation cracks are also formed in the crater. The calculation results show that the recrystallization mechanism in the ASB is subgrain rotational dynamic recrystallization.
Abstract: To improve the fatigue performance of remanufactured Ti-6Al-4V alloy, the combined laser cladding and laser shock peening(LSP) processes, as an anti-fatigue remanufacturing method, was adopted to restore the geometric shape of the simulated damaged samples and modify surface integrities of the repaired region. Microstructure variation, residual stress distribution, fatigue crack propogation rate and fracture morphology of Ti-6Al-4V alloy samples were examined before and after anti-fatigue remanufacturing. The results indicated that the laser cladding repaired component evolved gradually from equiaxed α and a small amount of β in the repaired substrate to typical Widmanstätten structure with fine acicular α and α + β basket weave in the repaired region. In anti-fatigue remanufactured zone, no new crystalline phase was created, β and α phases were refined obviously, high-density dislocations and abundant nanotwins with thickness of 10 to 30 nm were generated, and residual tensile stress was converted into compressive stress with the affected depth of about 900 μm. After anti-fatigue remanufacturing, the mean fatigue life of Ti-6Al-4V alloy samples was 2.64 times that of the matrix samples. A new method for calculating crack growth rate considering experimental uncertainty was presented. The fatigue crack propagation rate of Ti-6Al-4V specimens after anti-fatigue remanufacturing was significantly smaller than that of substrate samples, which was primarily attributed to the combined effects of Widmanstätten structure produced by laser cladding and LSP-induced favourable microstructural modification and the removing of tensile residual stress in the laser-clad repaired region.
Abstract: In this study, strong bonding of vacuum brazed synthetic diamond and Ti-6Al-4V substrates joints was achieved using a Ti-free eutectic AgCu filler alloy. It was found that the brazing temperature remarkably influenced the interfacial microstructures, and hence affected the bonding strength of brazed diamond joints. Thermodynamic calculation and TEM microstructural characterization revealed that the rapid adsorption and dissolution of Ti in molten filler alloy is responsible for the preferential precipitation of TiCu and/or Ti2Cu IMCs on the brazed diamond surface and the excessive formation of TiCu IMCs, which largely impaired the bonding strength of brazed Ti-6Al-4V/diamond joints. An evolution model exploring the microstructure and mechanical properties of the brazed joints on Ti-6Al-4V substrates was proposed, by taking the behavior of Ti adsorption into account. The underlying mechanism to gain a reliable bonding between Ti-6Al-4V substrate and diamond in this work is therefore of essential implications for the understanding of microstructure and bonding strength of other hard-to-wet materials on Ti-based substrates.
Abstract: Wrought-additive hybrid manufacturing technology effectively combines the advantages of high efficiency of traditional manufacturing and high flexibility of additive manufacturing technology. Mechanical Properties of welded joints is the key to evaluate the performance of parts. In this study, the wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) Ti-6Al-4V alloy was successfully connected with the wrought Ti-6Al-4V plate by electron beam welding (EBW). The effect of welding direction on microstructure and tensile properties of welded joints was studied. The results show that a large amount of needle martensite α’ phases exists in the joint due to the rapid cooling rate. The mechanical properties tests show that compared with the Wrought + SD (Scanning direction) sample, the Wrought + BD (Building direction) sample has higher tensile strength, but lower elongation. All samples fractured at the WAAMed Ti-6Al-4V side, which was related to the initial state of the WAAMed Ti-6Al-4V sample. The experiment also explored the fracture mechanism by TEM, which involved the nucleation, growth of cracks caused by vertical dislocation accumulation at the α/α’ phase interface, and occurrence of the displacement of the α (or α’)/β phase interface caused by the parallel dislocations.
Abstract: The nature of rapid cyclic heating and cooling in metal additive manufacturing poses a great challenge in the control of microstructure while a metallic part is being built. With metastable α′ martensites commonly present in a columnar prior-β grain structure, Ti-6Al-4V alloy made by laser powder-bed fusion additive manufacturing (L-PBF AM) is strong but often suffers from anisotropic mechanical behavior, inferior ductility and low fracture toughness. This drives the recent development in L-PBF process optimisation to produce ultrafine lamellar α + β microstructures directly in the as-built state of Ti-6Al-4V. Currently, in-situ martensite decomposition is deemed as the transformation pathway responsible for the formation of such lamellar microstructures. However, without solid experimental evidence this consensus cannot be reached and is still in question. Here we show that, instead of martensite decomposition, a pathway of slow cooling from the β phase field at much reduced cooling rates (below 5 °C s−1) is proven to give rise to the observed lamellar α + β microstructure. This is underpinned by several microstructural “fingerprints” such as grain-boundary α (GB-α), α colony and α lath width, and crystallographic orientations of the constituent phases. The finding deepens our established wisdom in L-PBF AM and opens a new avenue for microstructural control in metal additive manufacturing.
Abstract: The flow behavior of a Ti–6Al–4V alloy during warm forming was characterized, and the results were analyzed to reveal the causes of fracture during warm forging of a small Ti–6Al–4V alloy bolt. The experimental flow curves obtained by compression test of cylindrical specimens at the warm forming conditions were fitted by a general extended C–m model after post-processed by a high-accuracy temperature correction scheme. Finite element analyses of the compression tests were conducted at various sample temperatures and strain rates using the flow model, revealing that the predicted compression loads were consistent with the experimental results. Flow behavior was also analyzed to reveal the metallurgical and macroscopic instabilities of the Ti–6Al–4V alloy. The flow behavior, macroscopic instability indices, and predicted forming load-stroke curves of Ti–6Al–4V alloy and SCr420H alloy steel were compared. The results study revealed that fracturing of the material in the capping stage during the automatic multi-stage warm forging of the small Ti–6Al–4V alloy bolt was caused by the sharp decrease in the forming load in an unpredictably early stroke from macroscopic instability, as indicated quantitatively by its macroscopic instability index.
Abstract: Spherical Ti-6Al-4V powder was produced by RF plasma spheroidization combined with mechanical alloying and spray granulation. Particle size distribution, morphology, specific surface area, apparent density, flowability, element distribution and content of alloy powders after each stage during the process were investigated. Results show that the obtained spheroidized Ti-6Al-4V alloy powder has dense structure, good sphericity and high spheroidization ratio (98%), moderate particle size (37.8 μm) with narrow distribution. It also has excellent flowability (33.2 s· (50 g)-1) and apparent density (2.53 g·cm−3). In addition, elements distribution in the spherical Ti-6Al-4V alloy powder is uniform and most of elements content of it is within the standard of Ti-6Al-4V alloy.
Abstract: Efficient lattice unit cell topologies often necessitate the manufacture of unsupported horizontal struts. The fabrication of unsupported horizontal struts by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is inherently challenging, where the associated research data is limited for solid or dense cross-sections while no data exists for hollow struts. By examining LPBF-fabricated Ti-6Al-4V hollow struts of various diameters and wall thicknesses over increasing span lengths, a robust LPBF additive manufacturability range has been established for Ti-6Al-4V hollow struts. To achieve successful fabrication, three laser scan strategies were explored, proposed, and systematically compared. Horizontal solid struts and vertical hollow struts of equivalent diameters (and wall thickness) were similarly assessed over the same span lengths as comparators to quantify the manufacturability. This research provides previously unavailable design data, required for LPBF additive manufacturing of lattices with horizontal strut elements.
Abstract: In the present study the spheroidization of the microstructure during a solution heat treatment of hot-rolled Ti-6Al-4V (in m.%) is investigated by means of in-situ high-temperature electron backscatter diffraction. This technique delivers phase and orientation data next to a visualization of the morphological transformation of a discrete microstructural section. A comparison based on macroscopic hardness values and the results of quasi-static tensile tests was drawn between two types of microstructures, i.e. as-rolled and equiaxed. Complementarily, X-ray diffraction and light-optical microscopy were carried out for additional phase fraction analysis. The methods applied contribute to an improved understanding of the heat treatment performed on textured Ti-6Al-4V plate material, which was produced via a mixed β/α + β hot-rolling route. Furthermore, the influence of the created texture on the mechanical properties is revealed.
Abstract: Standard electron beam powder-bed fusion Ti-6Al-4V powder recovery and hot-isostatic pressing has been found to result in a surface layer microstructure change to globular α/β. Thickness control of this surface layer up to 15μm was demonstrated by varying powder recovery blasting working distance and duration. This surface globular layer was found to improve high-cycle rotating bending fatigue strength at 107 cycles by 60 MPa for specimens with smooth surfaces. The same trend was not observed for specimens with as-built surface roughness because globularization did not occur at dominant fatigue crack initiation sites; the roots of deep surface crevices.
Abstract: The effect of different solutionizing temperature and cooling rate on the extent of recovery, recrystallization and texture evolution in the alloy Ti-6Al-4V (Ti-64) has been investigated in different microstructural conditions. The hot rolled Ti-64 alloy was subjected to three different heat treatments in order to obtain three different microstructures, namely, lamellar (β-treatment), and equiaxed and bimodal (α/β-treatment). The heat treated alloys were characterized in terms of differences in phase fraction and phase dimension, the extent of recovery, recrystallization and texture evolution using SEM, EBSD, TEM, and XRD. The effect of heat treatment parameters on the volume fraction and grain size of primary α was more in bimodal microstructure than that of the equiaxed microstructure. The width of transformed α laths increases with increasing soaking temperature. Additionally, the extent of recovery and recrystallization of primary α was higher in equiaxed microstructure than in bimodal microstructure. The higher solutionizing temperature caused the dislocations in primary α to arrange themselves into lower energy substructures, which ultimately lead to subgrain formation. In transformed α laths, dislocations were generated due to lattice strain induced during β to α phase transformation. The rolling texture vanished gradually as the microstructure recovered and new recrystallized primary α grains grew. The newly formed recrystallized primary α grains and the majority of transformed α showed a moderate and strong prismatic texture respectively.
Abstract: Accurate fatigue life predictions of titanium alloy components requires an understanding of how the machining affected metallurgical and micro-mechanical subsurface condition influences fatigue crack nucleation and growth. This study investigates the influence of surface integrity features generated during carbide and high-speed polycrystalline diamond machining on the fatigue behaviour of coarse and fine-grained Ti-6Al-4V. Mechanically induced compressive residual stresses, promoted by higher feed rates and the larger cutting edge radii of carbide tools, have been demonstrated to provide an overriding enhancing effect on fatigue life due to crack initiation suppression and reducing the deleterious effects of microstructural deformation and surface imperfections.
Abstract: In this study, the corrosion behavior and mechanism of Ti-6Al-4V in artificial saliva with Candida albicans were investigated using electrochemical and surface analysis techniques. Fluorescence microscopy (FM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) showed that C. albicans could easily adsorb on the surface of Ti-6Al-4V alloy to form non-dense biofilm. The non-compact biofilm provided necessary conditions for pitting corrosion on Ti-6Al-4V alloys by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation. The potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed that C. albicans significantly reduced the corrosion resistance of Ti-6Al-4V alloys. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) results indicated that C. albicans biofilm promoted electron transfer from the anodic sites to cathodic depolarizer during the corrosion process, showing that the role of oral fungi must be considered when evaluating the performance of oral materials. This study may provide a new clue for evaluating the corrosion resistance of dental implant materials in the oral environment.
Abstract: Fatigue performance of metal alloys is inseparably associated with heterogenous microstructure and existing microdefects. The coordinated effects of lamellar microstructure (LM) and microdefect on fatigue performance of bimodal Ti-6Al-4V is studied within the framework of CPFEM. We propose an intragrain weight integration approach able to account for intragranular accumulative deformation. Parametric accumulative difference indicator (ADI) for stress is defined to relatively quantify the lamellar microstructural effect, overcoming the limitations of experimental procedures. The results demonstrate that the increase of β lath and synchronized refinement of LM appreciably improve lamellar microstructural effect. These attributes can be applied to the material design and manufacturing of advanced metal alloys.
Abstract: To enhance the high-temperature oxidation performance of Ti-6Al-4V alloy, we successfully prepared a TiNiSiCrCoAl high-entropy alloy coating on its surface via laser cladding technology. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and electron probe microanalysis were used to characterize the microstructure, elemental distribution, and high-temperature oxidation resistance of the coating. The results indicated that the microstructure of the coating was composed of a matrix and a σ phase. Owing to the rapid cooling via laser processing and the matched δ, ∆Hmix, and Ω, the matrix phase was an amorphous structure rich in Ti, Si, Cr, and Co, and the σ phase was an FCC structure rich in Ti, Ni, Co, and Al. The volume fraction of the amorphous-structured matrix in the coating increased with increasing laser scanning speed. The section after the oxidation treatment was composed of an oxide layer, a transition layer, and a coating matrix. The oxide layer was composed of TiO2, Al2O3, and NiAl2O4, and the transition layer was rich in Si, Ni, and Co. The amorphous-structured matrix exhibited a higher oxidation resistance than the FCC-structured σ phase. Compared with the Ti-6Al-4V substrate, the oxidation resistance of the coating increased by 10.7, 28.1, 40.5, and 65.1 times at different laser scanning speeds under oxidation at 800 °C for 48 h, which indicates that the coating has better oxidation resistance than the Ti-6Al-4V alloy at high temperatures.
Abstract: The beneficial effect of surface engineering on the wear and corrosion performance of Ti-6Al-4V alloy for biomedical purposes has recently gained a lot of interest. To date, researchers have shown TiN ceramic coatings to be an effective strategy to improve the poor tribocorrosion properties of Ti-based alloys. However, coating degradation and adhesions remains a major hurdle to overcome for successful clinical translation. Recently, a duplex TPON + TiN treatment process on Ti-alloy has been suggested for applications involving with high contact loads. For the first time, this technique was extended to the Additive Layer Manufactured (ALM) Ti-6Al-4V alloys in an attempt to enable load bearing patient personalised implants. The bio-tribology and corrosion resistance of the coated ALM materials were compared with that of the coatings on conventional wrought manufactured alloy for orthopaedic applications. XRD analysis showed that the coatings on both substrates are primarily composed of TiN. The Knoop microhardness technique proved a tribologically effective diffusion layer with a case depth of 35–45 μm. The LC2 and LC3 values were measured above 40 N and 60 N which is an excellent cohesive and adhesive strength for these types of the coatings. Electrochemical measurements in both static and sliding conditions showed a quick recovery capability of the protective layer in 25% Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS) diluted in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) electrolyte. The static electrochemical measurements also showed reduced corrosion current densities when compared to that of the bulk Ti-alloy. Coating on both substrates showed an excellent wear resistance which is correlated to the enhanced load bearing capacity of the coated surfaces. While the coating thickness was 3–6 μm, the wear depth was only 0.3 μm after 2 h of reciprocating sliding wear test.
Abstract: In this study, the stress relaxation (SR) behaviors of a Ti-6Al-4V alloy pre-loaded from elastic to plastic regions and corresponding strength evolution mechanisms at different temperatures were systematically studied. In order to quantitatively analyze the detailed deformation and strength evolution mechanisms during the whole SR tests, which is composed of the loading stage and subsequent SR stage, the evolutions of α/β structures and dislocations have been identified by a series of microstructural observations, i.e., scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). A great quantity of entangled dislocations in α phase introduced by the plastic loading at temperatures below 800 °C promotes the emergence of SR behavior with a higher creep rate, leading to the much higher SR level with larger pre-load levels. Diffusion is significantly enhanced by dislocations accumulated at interfaces with higher temperatures (> 800 °C), contributing to a similar SR phenomenon under different initial strain levels. Apparent strength loss has been observed after SR with high temperatures or pre-loaded to the plastic region, e.g., 94 MPa loss for 800 °C, pre-loaded with a stain of 10% and SR for 2400 s. The strength loss mainly comes from the loading stage where distorted and fragmented β layers occur. The subsequent SR stage facilitates interfacial diffusion and results in a higher fraction of granular β phases, leading to a further decrease in yield strength (YS). This study enhances the understanding on the deformation and strength evolution mechanisms of titanium alloys with lamellar structures in the whole SR process, providing a physical foundation for optimizing the processing parameters for manufacturing titanium alloy components with high accuracy and performance.
Abstract: Titanium alloys in dry machining interacts with cutting tool, resulting in rapid tool wear, and poor surface quality. A highly chemically stable Al2O3-ZrO2 ceramic insert was used to examine the effect of cutting speed, depth of cut, and feed rate, on performance measures of surface roughness, and tool wear mechanism. The result shows that the primary tool wear mechanism is abrasion and chipping when cutting speed and depth of cut both at low level, while diffusion at the crater, resulting formation of built-up-edge leads to catastrophic tool fracture at high level of cutting speed and depth of cut. The surface roughness is enhanced by 69.6% when cutting speed is at high level and depth of cut at low level.
Abstract: The fatigue crack growth (FCGR) behaviour of titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V submitted to Hot Isostatic Pressing through CT specimens manufactured by Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is analysed. Both the crack growth under constant amplitude loading and the transient crack growth behaviour after the application of overloads or underloads were studied. The effect of the mean stress and the transient delay behaviour were studied using the crack closure parameter. The HIP treatment showed an increment in the FCGR strength increasing the fatigue threshold, the critical stress intensity factor and the FCGR resistance. Crack closure induced by plasticity for the stress ratio R = 0 was observed and for R = 0.4 no crack closure was detected. The applied overloads caused a FCGR retardation due to the increase of crack closure effect induced by plasticity resulting from the overloads while for underloads application no change in the FCGR behaviour and crack closure levels was observed. The overloads applied with 100% intensity for R = 0.4 achieved a high level of plasticity in the crack tip leading to higher crack retardation and superior transient period due to a higher zone affected by the overloads.
Abstract: Although titanium alloys can be operative at high temperatures up to 700 ∘C, their mechanical properties at ultrahigh temperatures are not well studied. In this work, an automatic testing system is designed for the modified piezoelectric ultrasonic composite oscillator technique (M-PUCOT) to measure the elastic moduli and internal frictions of two different Ti-6Al-4V alloys from room temperature to 1200 ∘C. The results show that for the as-received Ti-6Al-4V (with standard heat treatment), which contains an equiaxed α phase and a small amount of the β phase, a large internal friction peak due to the phase transition (α+β→β) is observed for the first time. However, for the Ti-6Al-4V annealed at 1200 ∘C, no phase transition peak is observed; instead, a weak Debye-type peak is observed. Moreover, the elastic moduli and hardness are significantly enhanced, which is attributed to the increase in interstitial oxygen atoms and the complete formation of the Widmanstätten α structure.
Abstract: In this work, ZrTiO4/TiO2 composite coatings were synthesized via plasma electrolytic oxidation process, representing multifunctional applications ranging from corrosion resistance to photocatalytic performance. We produced ceramic coatings on Ti-6Al-4V alloy under different current density conditions (2, 4, and 6 A/dm2) with an electrolyte containing Na3PO4.12H2O and ZrO2 nanoparticles. Prepared coatings were analyzed through SEM, XRD, AFM, and the sessile drop technique to measure contact angle. The cytotoxicity, electrochemical, and photocatalysis behavior of coatings were evaluated using MG63 cell, Hank's physiological, and methylene blue solution, respectively. The apatite forming ability in SBF (bioactivity behavior) and the release of Ti, Al, V, and Zr of composite coating were examined for optimum coating. The pore size, thickness, roughness, and porosity percentage increased with ascending the current density from 2 to 6 A/dm2, whereas the wettability of oxide coatings decreased moderately. ZrO2 nanoparticles were experienced reactive incorporation to the coating during PEO process, resulting in the formation of ZrTiO4 phases. The in vitro corrosion resistance and MG63 cell response indicated that the increment in current density has detrimental effects on electrochemical behavior and cell attachment of PEO-treated coatings. The apparent constant rate of MB photodegradation in the presence of the Zr3CD2 coating was about 3.15 times faster than the PEO coating without ZrO2 nanoparticles produced with 2 A/dm2 current density. Moreover, although the microstructure of PEO coating produced at the current density of 2 A/dm2 was fruitful for the apatite phase deposition, it accelerated the Al and V ion release rather than untreated sample.
Abstract: The most popular additive manufacturing (AM) technologies to produce titanium alloy parts are electron beam melting (EBM), selective laser melting (SLM) and directed energy deposition (DED). This investigation explores mainly these three techniques and compares these three methods comprehensively in terms of microstructure, tensile properties, porosity, surface roughness and residual stress based on the information available in the literature. It was found that the microstructure is affected by the highest temperature generated and the cooling rate which can be tailored by the input variables of the AM processes. The parts produced from EBM have strength comparable to that of conventionally fabricated counterparts. SLM and DED yield superior strength, which can be up to 25% higher than traditionally manufactured products. Due to the presence of larger tensile residual stress, surface roughness and porosity, AM fabricated parts have lower fatigue life compared to those of from traditional methods. EBM parts have slightly lower fracture toughness (i.e., lower fatigue life) than conventionally produced parts while SLM and DED have significantly lower fracture toughness. Annealing, hot isostatic pressing, stress relief and additional machining processes improve the characteristics of parts produced from AM. Ti–6Al–4V alloy parts fabricated via AM may have limited applications despite the high demands in aerospace or biomedical engineering. Since rapid product development using 3D printers leads to significant cost reductions more recently, it is expected that more opportunities may soon be available for the AM of titanium alloys with newer AM processes such as cold spray additive manufacturing (CSAM) and additive friction stir deposition (AFSD).
Abstract: This study investigates the temperature-dependent dwell fatigue behavior of Ti-6Al-4V alloy using crystal plasticity finite element method. The dislocation mechanism-based crystal plasticity parameters are calibrated with the data of quasi-static tensile and constant load creep tests at ambient and intermediate temperatures. In particular, the rate-dependent parameters related to slip property are employed to establish the relationship between strain rate sensitivity of a soft α-titanium single crystal and temperature. The variation of strain rate sensitivity with temperature influences the stress redistribution occurring within the hard-soft grain combination, which in turn affects the dwell fatigue sensitivity. Further, the structural analysis for a Ti-6Al-4V fan disc provides the stress fields at takeoff and cruise phases to examine the in-service stress redistribution. The highly localized hoop stress and presence of large macrozones at the bore of the fan disc, rather than the fair rate sensitivity of soft macrozones at working temperatures, are responsible for triggering basal stress enhancement and dwell facet nucleation in hard macrozones.
Abstract: In powder-based metal additive manufacturing, one key specification that needs to be precisely optimized is the particle shape and size distribution of metallic powders. Particle shape and size distribution influences the flowability of the powder and the uniformity of powder bed density (i.e. packing state of the powder). These eventually affect the porosity, which ultimately influences the fatigue performance of the fabricated parts. Therefore, it is essential to understand the effect of powder characteristics on the fatigue behavior before additively manufactured parts can be used in load-bearing, safety-critical applications. The current study aims at assessing the effects of powder particle size and morphology on mechanical properties and fatigue response of laser beam powder bed fused (LB-PBF) Ti-6Al-4V; an alpha-beta workhorse alloy of the titanium family. Several Ti-6Al-4V powder batches with different size distributions are used to fabricate the parts employing an EOS M290 machine. Powder characteristics, including flowability, compressibility, cohesion, size, and shape morphology, are investigated to reveal the differences between the two tested powder batches. Porosity levels and mechanical testing results are compared among specimens fabricated from different powder batches and the differences are explained based on variations in powder characteristics.
Abstract: The influence of laser shock peening without coating (LPwC) on the induced compressive residual stress and the fatigue behaviour (R = −1 at 300 °C) was investigated on curved samples of Ti-6Al-4V. The stress relaxation after fatigue was also examined. In the peened samples crack initiation shifted to a depth of ∼ 200 μm, with 3 fold increase in fatigue life at 400 MPa. Decrease in fatigue striations in the laser peened (331.48 nm/cycle) samples compared to unpeened (410.54 nm/cycle) samples indicated retardation of crack propagation rate. Further, the effect of grain refinement and misorientation angles on fatigue behaviour is also considered.
Abstract: Direct energy deposition (DED) is a promising additive manufacturing technique in the area of aerospace, automotive, shipbuilding and medical industries. DED allows producing large-scale parts that imply the use of a significant amount of powders. Powder reuse is an important task that leads to a reduction in the cost of the final products. In this work, Ti-6Al-4V samples were fabricated by DED technique with a mixture of unused and recycled powders in the recycled powder content of 0%, 10%, 25%, and 50%. The results show that the morphology of the powder does not change significantly due to a low number of powder uses. Chemical analysis reveals a slight decrease of V in the recycled powder. The evolution of macrostructure with increasing recycled powder content was not revealed. In the as-built samples, the columnar prior β grains grow toward the build direction with a typical Widmanstätten structure consisting of the thin α' laths. The mix of Widmanstätten microstructure and basket weave microstructure appears after the annealing at 800 ℃. Furthermore, the horizontal and vertical annealed samples exhibit ductile fracture and inconspicuous anisotropy of tensile and impact mechanical properties.
Abstract: The results of experimental investigations and molecular dynamics simulation of deformation and fracture of as-built wire-feed EBAM Ti-6Al-4V samples and the samples subjected to ultrasonic impact treatment are presented. Dislocation deformation of the samples under uniaxial tension is shown to occur through propagation of fine and coarse slip bands and shear bands. The ultrasonic impact treatment results in the formation of a 10 μm thick top layer consisting of the nanocrystalline α-Ti, β-Ti and TiO2 phases and an underlying 30–50 μm thick layer, which microstructure is characterized by curved and fragmented α-phase lamellae. As a consequence, dislocation sliding in the ultrasonically treated surface layer of the wire-feed EBAM Ti-6Al-4V samples is hindered. Molecular dynamics simulation has revealed that the grain boundary sliding and twinning are the main deformation mechanisms of the fragmented α-phase lamellae. The migration of the twin boundaries was happened by means of the development of reversible HCP→BCC→HCP transformations. At the prefracture stage the non-crystallographic shear bands nucleating in the underlying layers propagate in the ultrasonically treated surface layer. Intensive deformation inside the shear bands manifests itself in the formation of regions with ductile microrelief on the brittle fracture surface.
Abstract: Electron Beam Melting is an additive manufacturing process that allows the creation of high-resolution parts with complex shapes, starting from a powder feedstock and using an electron beam as the energy input. Due to the high costs of the powder, the excess one must be reused otherwise a high percentage of unused powder would be lost after the printing process. The virgin and reused powders may have not the same characteristics, and therefore the printed parts may not have the same final quality which is detrimental to mechanical performances. However, this topic still needs research, as the influence of recycling on powder characteristics is not fully understood. In this study, the internal defects, and their distribution in virgin and recycled Ti-6Al-4V powders particles, are investigated by means of an optical microscope. For the analysis of the surface morphology and the external characteristics, it was used the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). At the end, a commercial software ImageJ was used in order to provide some quantitative results on the internal porosity percentage. The results demonstrate the dependence on the powder atomization process, which is primarily responsible for the micro-porosities, due to the trapped gas in virgin powders, and the rough surface morphology, including the presence of various satellites. As the number of reuses increases, the quantity of satellites decreases, probably due to the partial melting on the surface, which consequently returns in rougher surfaces of the recycled powder particles. In addition, most of the internal porosities disappeared making the cross-sectional faces of the particles near fully dense.
Abstract: The study is focused on the surface integrity generated during the surfacing process of Ti-6Al-4V with a wiper edge length tool insert. Previous experiments with this tool showed the predominance of the wiper edge length over the operating parameters towards the generation of surface integrity (roughness and surface residual stresses) and allowed us to define a removal rate area where tool wear is controlled. In this paper, surface integrity is analysed in high productivity finishing including high feed rate (up to 2,8 mm/tooth) and high cutting speed (up to 400m/min). Recommendations on operating parameters for wiper edge length tools were established based on the results.
Abstract: The paper is aimed to investigate the effect of lamellar structure distribution around elliptical notch in bimodal titanium alloys of Ti-6Al-4V. In this regard, within the framework of crystal plasticity based finite element (CPFE), Representative volume element (RVE) model with elliptical notch for bimodal Ti–6Al–4V is developed, to address the effect of lamellar structure on fatigue resistance performance under external fatigue loading. Lamellar structure distribution around elliptical notches with different aspect ratios are investigated. Strain along radial and circular paths are extracted to identify the possible crack initiation points. The numerical results show that, Strain distribution around notches can be adjusted through lamellar structure distribution such that strain uniformity is achieved. Increase of strain oscillation caused by lamellar structure leads to the improvement of fatigue resistance. With the increase of notch aspect ratio, elliptical notch eventually evolves into line crack and tuning performance of lamellar structure appreciably declines. This numerical study provides a new insight into lamellar structure tuning in dual-phase titanium alloys.
Abstract: Due to the poor thermal properties of titanium alloys, heat generated and accumulated in the cutting area significantly affects tool life and workpiece quality. Although some methods have been proposed to measure the cutting temperature during machining titanium alloys, there still exist disadvantages including low spatial-temporal resolution, low measuring accuracy, restricted usage environment, etc. In this paper, a novel near-infrared two-color pyrometer system is developed and applied to measure the cutting zone temperature under dry and wet cutting of Ti‐6Al‐4V alloy. The developed pyrometer can eliminate the emissivity effect and shows a good linear relationship between the output signal ratio and the calibrated temperature. Meanwhile, the developed pyrometer exhibits good dynamic response and high measuring accuracy when measuring tool edge temperature and chip temperature in dry cutting conditions. In addition, a reliable sealing for cutter assembly is developed to overcome the influence of cutting fluid on the optic-fiber probe and the developed pyrometer can measure the tool edge temperature quickly and accurately in wet cutting conditions. In summary, the novel near-infrared two-color pyrometer system is validated to be quick responsiveness, high measuring accuracy, and good working stability when monitoring the cutting zone temperature under dry and wet cutting of Ti‐6Al‐4V alloy.
Abstract: Understanding the manufacturing process parameters and their correlation with final product functional properties is needed to ensure performance in critical applications in the medical industry. This article presents the holistic procedure for verifying the quality of manufactured products, including the determination of basic material characteristics and strength parameters based on EBM (Electron Beam Melting) technology for the titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V ELI. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the manufacturing and post-processing methods used, on the geometric accuracy, microstructure, mechanical and cytotoxic properties of additively manufactured parts, especially in the form of personalized jaw implants. The effect of Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) treatment on microstructure and properties is also taken into account. The EBM manufacturing process was developed and samples were built using three different orientations: 0° (horizontally), 45° (diagonally), and 90° (vertically). The novel results are systematically presented and discussed beginning from the selection of process parameters, sample manufacturing, wide microstructural characterization, determination of static mechanical properties as well as geometric accuracy, and quality control verification depending on the manufacturing process and the post-processing methods used. The conducted research allowed for the presentation of the entire process chain of the EBM manufactured medical implant made of high-purity titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V ELI), thus filling the scientific gaps related to the selective presentation and discussion of research results published in the literature on the subject.
Abstract: Rapidly developing additive technologies for metallic parts production have led to the development of a wide range of methods supporting this field, including mechanical properties characterization. Components produced by AM processes are built spot to spot and layer by layer and that leads to varying local heat absorption and distribution, resulting in varying local properties depending on the shape complexity and build parameters. Different properties in different directions and at various component locations can be expected. Since AM parts are often sub-scale and/or with topological complexity, mechanical characterization with the use of standard specimens is not typically possible and small-sized specimen techniques have to be developed and applied. In the current paper, three AM produced parts made of Ti-6Al-4V by Electron Beam Powder Bed Fusion (EB-PBF) technology have been investigated. Three material conditions are reported here: as-deposited, stress relieved and HIP-ed. Local mechanical properties are assessed with the use of miniaturized compact tension (MCT) fracture toughness specimens and miniaturized tensile tests (MTT). The results are complemented by microstructural and fractographic analysis and are discussed in the light of literature values.
Abstract: As a result of its excellent mechanical characteristics and bio-compatibility, the Ti-6Al-4V alloy offers a wide-ranging applications in the medical industry. However, long-term application of these alloys may lead to a decline in corrosion resistance as well as other serious problems in these alloys. To resolve these problems, it is possible to modify the implant surface to enhance the corrosion and bio-compatibility properties. On the Ti-6Al-4V substrate surface, the TiN coating was applied by the Plasma-Assisted Chemical Vapour Deposition (PACVD) method together with the hydroxyapatite coating (HA) using the sol–gel method. Furthermore, the corrosion performance of bio-active hydroxyapatite layer coating on Ti-6Al-4V implant surface was evaluated through the application of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Gene Expression Programming (GEP) models. The generated models were analysed and compared to a response surface methodology (RSM). The hydroxyapatite sol–gel parameters on Ti-6Al-4V implant materials were used as independent variables (input variables). The Ecorr values computed from potentiodynamic polarization measurements were used as a dependent variable (output variable) in the models. The results of the ANN technique (sigmoid activation function, LM training algorithm and 9 neurons in hidden layer) were in good consistent with the experimental Ecorr values, indicating this model is slightly better than the GEP and RSM models. Finally, the findings demonstrated that the ANN technique is an appropriate and robust tool for quantitative modeling of corrosion resistance, and that it can be applied to a variety of surface engineering applications.
Abstract: The transformed α grains of selective laser melted Ti-6Al-4V display a strong (0001) fiber texture along the building direction, whereas during SLM printing, the parent high temperature β grains have preferentially grown in the <001> parallel to the building direction. In the current work, we have studied the phenomenon of variant selection occuring during the cubic to hexagonal phase transformation by investigating in detail the distribution of misorientation pairs and intervariant boundaries observed in orientation contrast maps acquired by EBSD. It was found that local variant selection within a single parent grain governed the martensitic transformation as it was observed that the experimentally assessed distribution of intervariant axis/angle pairs significantly differed from the one that can be expected if the Burgers orientation relationship applies with equal probability of the 12 possible variants. The variant selection could be explained by considering the degree of self-accommodation, which is corroborated by the characteristic morphologies formed by three- variant clusters as observed in the orientation contrast maps. Irrespective of the misorientation, the grain boundary characterization distribution revealed a strong anisotropic distribution of the internal interfaces with a tendency of alignment of these interfaces with the {hki0} prismatic planes. The dominant [10¯553¯]/ 63.26° intervariant boundaries displayed primarily twist and 180-tilt (3¯210) boundary planes.
Abstract: Ti-6Al-4V alloy turbine components for aeronautical applications operate at a steady state after reaching the maximum stress during each duty cycle. The load holds combined with the fatigue process causes a phenomenon called the dwell effect. The dwell periods reduce the fatigue strength of disks and blades of aeronautical turbine engines made of titanium alloys. In this work, trapezoidal dwell-fatigue and triangular fatigue tests were performed with a fatigue ratio of 0.1 at room temperature. The trapezoidal waveforms (dwell-fatigue tests) had a 10-second dwell period and 1-second loading and unloading rates for each fatigue cycle. The triangular waveforms (fatigue tests) were equivalent to trapezoidal waveforms with zero seconds at the maximum stress. The Weibull distribution was used to analyze the dwell-fatigue data statistically. The experimental results showed that the dwell-fatigue life debits for dwell periods of 10 seconds at stress levels of 1.0, 0.975, and 0.95 of the material yield strength were 10.2, 10.0, and 4.5, respectively. The results suggest that the dwell sensitivity of Ti-6Al-4V alloy increases at high-stress levels. The fracture of dwell-fatigue specimens occurred at a high-cumulated plastic strain and after a significantly lower fatigue life than at pure fatigue tests, indicating a substantial dwell-life debit of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The damage mechanism responsible for reducing the fatigue life when the dwell time was introduced was the plastic deformation accumulation observed in dwell-fatigue tests, possibly as a result of the stress redistribution mechanism in the α phase grains that leads to slip of dislocations and, consequently, early plastic deformation processes that instigate crack nucleation.
Abstract: Although wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) of Ti alloys using gas metal arc yields a high deposition rate, cathode spots exhibit unstable behavior. In this study, the cold-metal-transfer process and an electrode-negative (EN) polarity were used in the WAAM process of the Ti–6Al–4V alloy. High-speed imaging was performed to investigate the mechanisms to stabilize cathode plasma jets, arc plasma, and molten metal transfer in the EN polarity. Arc plasma and cathode jets had the same direction, and sound cathode jets were shrouded by arc plasma in the EN mode. The metal transfer was also stabilized by balanced plasma formation under the EN mode, and inconsistent wire melting under the electrode-positive (EP) mode was mitigated. In the deposition test using the EN mode, distributed heating of the substrate and depressed molten pool were observed, which resulted in a 21.0% increase in the bead width and 27% decrease in the wetting angle compared with the EP mode. This study demonstrated that the instability of the gas metal arc WAAM process of Ti alloys can be overcome with the EN-mode cold metal arc process.
Abstract: This study adopted a multiscale surface integrity approach (macro, micro, and sub-micro scale) to study the effects of cutting conditions and varying cutting fluid applications on the final surface state in Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Surface integrity parameters that were studied in this work are surface roughness, subsurface microhardness, residual stresses, and microstructural alterations. The results show that there is some correlation between microstructural and mechanical characteristics of machining-induced surface integrity. Also, different residual stress profiles were obtained for TMQF (Targeted Minimum Quantity Fluid) machining (compressive residual stress profile) and flood machining (tensile residual stress profile), which underlines the importance of selecting the right cutting fluid application. This work could aid in choosing the right cutting fluid application for the finish machining operation of Ti-6Al-4V alloy to obtain a desired final superior surface integrity. TMQF application conditions produced better surface integrity metrics (lower surface roughness, compressive surface residual stresses, and no undesirable microstructural damage) compared to flood fluid application while finish machining of Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy.
Abstract: The cellular structured titanium alloys have attracted significant attention for implants because of their lower Youngʼs modulus, which is comparable to human bone and has the capability of providing space for bone tissue in-growth. However, there is a gap in the knowledge in regard to the relationship between the pore characteristics and the electrochemical performance of open-cellular structured titanium alloys. In this study, we elucidate the influence of pore characteristics on the electrochemical performance of open-cellular structured Ti-6Al-4V alloys produced by electron beam melting (EBM). Intriguingly, the passive film formed on cellular structured Ti-6Al-4V alloy with a larger pore size was more stable and protective, and the corrosion performance was superior compared to the samples with a smaller pore size in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), mainly because of relatively smaller exposed surface area and unlimited flow of electrolyte. However, in acidic PBS containing fluoride ions, the pore characteristics did not play an important role in the corrosion resistance. It was considered that the protective film breaks down such that the corrosion performance of cellular structured alloys was comparable to each other in this harsh environment.
Abstract: The ratcheting behaviour of the additively manufactured and thermo-mechanically treated Ti–6Al–4V alloy has been investigated. Post heat treatment microstructures of comparable mechanical strength properties have been developed from both the material. Additively manufactured Ti–6Al–4V has a heterogeneous microstructure with defects and residual stresses as compared to the homogeneous microstructure of thermo-mechanically treated Ti–6Al–4V. It has been found that the fatigue life of the as-built additively manufactured sample is less than 50% of the thermo-mechanically treated sample and the fatigue life decreases further after heat treatment. The macroscopic cyclic stress-strain behaviour could not be predicted well using the combined hardening model in the Finite Element Method for the additively manufactured alloy. This has been attributed to the heterogeneous evolution of microscopic strain investigated using the Digital image correlation (DIC) technique. The detrimental effect of heterogeneity of the microstructure on the ratcheting behaviour of the heat-treated additively manufactured alloy has been investigated using the Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique. It reveals that the presence of multi-variant needle-shaped martensite is effective in increasing the crack propagation resistance and increasing the fatigue life of the as-built additively manufactured alloy as compared to its heat-treated counterparts in which both lamellar and acicular morphology of alpha is prevalent.
Abstract: High cycle fatigue properties of material obtained with additive manufacturing (AM) processes such as LPBF (Laser Powder Bed Fusion) remain misunderstood. These properties are complex due to the porous and anisotropic features of AM parts. Moreover, a high number of process parameters can influence the obtained fatigue behavior. In this context, a rapid determination of the high and very high cycle fatigue properties is necessary in order to optimize process parameters with regard to fatigue response. This first work aims to produce test pieces with different porosity rates and microstructures. The processing and post-processing parameters leading to different porosity rates, porosity size distribution and microstructure are determined and presented. In a future work, the fatigue response will be then compare using two accelerated fatigue determination methods: ultrasonic fatigue testing and fatigue limit evaluation through lock-in thermography.
Abstract: High-strength titanium alloys are necessary and essential in aviation and aerospace fields. Attempt to enhance the strength of the most widely used Ti-6Al-4V alloy is significant. However, it is hard to obtain high strength (>1300 MPa) combining with adequate ductility (elongation>12%) for this alloy. In this study, Ti-6Al-4V alloy with high yield strength (1280 MPa), excellent ultimate tensile strength (1358 MPa) and proper elongation (13.7%) was successfully prepared by an innovative strategy based on electropulsing. The strong electron flow of electropulsing induced rapid temperature rise and yielded instantaneous phase transformation, which limited alloying elements diffusing and parent β size growing, and followed by different phase transformations in Al or V solute enriched regions in one parent β grain during the cooling process. The particular microstructure evolution resulted in efficient α′ lath refinement. Then, the strength can be greatly enhanced by the decomposition of fine α' after subsequent aging. Meanwhile, the V and Al generally kept the initial microstructural partition and resulted in a novel bi-lamellar microstructure, which led to proper ductility. The results and analysis provide a novel method and new idea to improve and control the mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4V and other titanium alloys.
Abstract: Up to now, the composition design in the field of Ti-based in-situ dendrite reinforced bulk metallic glass composites (BMGCs) has been a great challenge. In this work, a simple but effective strategy is proposed to tailor the dendrite composition and volume fraction by using conventional Titanium alloy Ti–6Al–4V, and a series of in-situ dendrite reinforced BMGCs (Z1-Z4) are prepared based on it. The dendrite volume fraction can be adjusted by changing the proportion of the Titanium alloy Ti–6Al–4V, while the compositions of the dendrites are highly correlated with Ti–6Al–4V. In these alloys, with the increase of the mass percent of the added Titanium alloy Ti–6Al–4V, the volume fraction of the dendrite phase increases monotonically from Z1 to Z4 alloy. Z1 alloy behaves like a BMG with a high yield strength and limited plasticity due to its small dendrite size. Z2-Z4 alloys show excellent plasticity and significant work-hardening ability, because the dendrite size is appropriate and the dendrites undergo stress-induced martensite transformation during compression. From Z2 to Z4 alloy, with the increase of dendrite volume fraction from 56% to 78%, the yield strength does not decrease, which is due to the gradually enhanced stability of the dendrites. This composition design strategy is effective and universal, which can provide a new perspective for the composition design and development of TiZr-based in-situ dendrite reinforced BMGCs.
Abstract: The aim of this research is to study the influence of cutting fluid (Straight oil) and various input factors (speed, feed, and depth of cut) on material removal rate and the surface roughness while turning Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy using a Micromatic automated CNC lathe machine. A mathematical prediction model has been developed to study the influence of above mentioned parameters on material removal rate and surface roughness. The mathematical prediction model uses Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Response surface plots that are generated by the model helps in determining the optimum combination of input factors for best possible material removal rate and surface roughness. The developed prediction model shows that the depth of cut followed by speed are the significant input factor that control material removal rate. Similarly, feed followed by the depth of cut are the critical input factors that influence surface roughness. An increase in material removal rate is observed with an increase in depth of cut and speed. The decrease in surface roughness is noticed with a decrease in feed and depth of cut. A confirmation test is carried out to validate the developed model. An error of less than 5% is observed between the predicted and the experimental value of material removal rate and surface roughness.
Abstract: In this study, precipitation phenomena of bone-like apatite on plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO)-treated Ti-6Al-4V alloys with various electrolyte compositions were studied by using various characterization techniques. A Ti-6Al-4V disk was used as a sample for the PEO treatment, which was performed using pulsed DC power for 3 min at 280 V in an electrolyte solution containing calcium acetate, calcium glycerophosphate, manganese(II) acetate tetrahydrate, magnesium acetate tetrahydrate, strontium acetate hemihydrate, zinc acetate dehydrate, and sodium metasilicate at 25 °C. The PEO-treated samples were immersed in a simulated body fluid (SBF) solution for 24 h to investigate their bioactivity. The surface morphology, composition, and microstructure of these samples were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, and X-ray diffractometry. The surface of the PEO-treated alloy in the electrolyte containing Ca, P, Mn, Sr, Zn, Mg, and Si ions was covered with precipitates that formed a ring pattern around the pores. Furthermore, Mn was detected in the pores rather than on the surface; this Mn played a role in MnO2 and Mn2O3 formation on the PEO-treated alloy surface. Moreover, on the surface treated in SBF solution after PEO treatment in the electrolyte containing Ca, P, Mn, Sr, Zn, Mg, and Si ions, apatite nucleation occurred in the pores, which coalesced and grew into large precipitates. Fewer number of functional elements, including Mn, were detected on the surface when apatite was precipitated, than that in the case of the non-treated surface in the SBF solution.
Abstract: The biological performance of Ti-6Al-4V implant is primarily determined by their surface properties. However, traditional surface modification methods, such as acid etching, hardly make improvement in their osseointegration ability and antibacterial capacity. In this study, we prepared a multi-scale composite structure coated with zinc oxide (ZnO) on Ti-6Al-4V implant by an innovative technology of two-step laser processing combined with solution-assistant. Compared with the acid etching method, the physicochemical properties of surface significantly improved. The in vitro results showed that the particular dimension of micro-nano structure and the multifaceted nature of ZnO synergistically affected MC3T3-E1 osteogenesis and bacterial activities: (1) The surface morphology showed a ‘contact guidance’ effect on cell arrangement, which was conducive to the adhesion of filopodia and cell spreading, and the osteogenesis level of MC3T3-E1 was enhanced due to the release of zinc ions (Zn2+); (2) the characterization of bacterial response revealed that periodic nanostructures and Zn2+ released could cause damage to the cell wall of E. coli and reduce the adhesion and aggregation of S. aureus. In conclusion, the modified surface showed a synergistic effect of physical topography and chemical composition, making this a promising method and providing new insight into bone defect repairment.
Abstract: In this work, experimental and numerical approaches are performed to explore the influence of scanning strategies on the microstructure, crystallographic texture as well as the mechanical behavior of Ti-6Al-4V alloy manufactured by Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF). In-situ monitored data of the energy intensity show that different scanning strategies result in variations of energy intensity distribution. The characterization of the microstructure and crystallographic texture reveals that the sample with hexagon scan pattern displays the structure with columnar primary β phase, while the specimens with chessboard scan exhibit equiaxial-like morphology. EBSD and TEM results provide evidence of the appearance of residual β nanoparticles. A finite element model is developed to further explain the phase transformation during LPBF and the formation mechanism of residual β particles. The numerical results indicate that the appearance of the residual β phase is attributed to the preheating/reheating effect by the adjacent tracks and successive layers, and the final phase composition of the LPBF-built Ti-6Al-4V alloy combines the α′, α, and β phases. Findings in the present paper show that various scanning strategies lead to a clear diversification in the microstructure, crystallographic texture, and phase composition of LPBF-built samples, which opens a route towards the tailoring of mechanical properties and isotropic behaviors in additive manufacturing.
Abstract: This work investigated the substrate effect on the additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, of Ti–6Al–4V alloy products by the wire-feed electron beam additive manufacturing. It was shown that the etching degree and the shape of the layer bands, known as heat-affected zones, are determined by the heat dissipation rate during 3D printing. Increasing the temperature gradient using a grade 2 Ti substrate decreases the α-phase plate thickness to 0.56 μm and provides the highest material strength and microhardness values among all tested samples. It was found that using substrates of technically pure Ti, the Al content in the bottom part of the wall decreases due to a mutual diffusion of substrate and sample materials. At the same time, at the printing on a Ti–Al–Mo–V alloy substrate, Mo does not penetrate the deposited material volume. Finally, the optimal substrate variants are determined to achieve the highest strength and elongation of the additively manufactured material at the selected fabrication parameters.
Abstract: The formation of internal stresses during quenching of titanium alloys from the β phase field are investigated both experimentally and by simulation, in order to show the effects of phase transformations. Two titanium alloys are considered: the β-metastable Ti17 alloy and the α+β Ti–6Al–4V alloy. During the quench into water of laboratory scale samples (40 mm diameter cylinders), no phase transformations occurred in the Ti17 alloy because of its β-metastable character and the fast cooling. However, β→α+β and β→α′ phase transformations occurred in the Ti–6Al–4V sample. Both alloys are compared in order to highlight the effects of the phase transformations. Residual stresses were determined by neutron diffraction, by the contour method and at the surface by the hole drilling method. A model for the coupled thermal, mechanical and metallurgical evolutions is established in order to simulate the quenching operations. The material model for the Ti17 alloy was established in a previous study. Regarding the Ti–6Al–4V alloy, modeling approaches and experimental data from literature are utilized to build the material model. From both experiment and simulation, it is found that the internal stress evolutions are governed by the thermal gradients. The phase transformations have a weak impact because of the small deformation strains induced by the phase change. Nevertheless, good prediction of the phase transformation kinetics is necessary for accurate simulations, because the α and α’ phases strengthen the alloy, thereby limiting the plastic straining at the origin of the residual stresses. As most plastic strains are cumulated at high temperature, the thermomechanical model should be established accurately over the temperature ranges in which there is a significant proportion of β phase.
Abstract: The fatigue crack growth (FCGR) behavior of titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V submitted to Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) through CT specimens manufactured by Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is analyzed. Both the crack growth under constant amplitude loading and the transient crack growth behavior after the application of overloads were studied. Crack closure induced by plasticity for the stress ratio R=0 was observed at the Paris regime. The applied overloads for OLR=2 at R=0 caused a FCGR retardation due to the increase of crack closure effect induced by plasticity resulting from the overloads. Rapid transient periods were registered due to small zone affected by the overloads.
Abstract: A ternary Ti-25Al-17 Nb coating (89.5 vol. % O phase and 4.3 vol. % α2 phase) was fabricated from the pre-alloyed powder by in-situ laser synthesis. The powder was laser scanned to form α2 phase at high temperature and subsequently precipitated primary Ti2AlNb phase (O phase) in an acicular structure; while the secondary fine acicular O phase was squeezed due to the expansion of α2 phase with induced some edge dislocations and mixed dislocations. The dense and hard Al2O3 film gradually replaced the loose and porous TiO2 oxide film as an oxygen diffusion barrier, thereby reducing the possibility of brittle oxide formation and significantly increasing the wear resistance and oxidation resistance, results in an excellent wear resistance at 800 ℃.
Abstract: Double shot peening is the development of shot peening by shooting large media as a first shot and re-shooting again with smaller media as a second shot in order to achieve high residual compressive stress and hardness at the surface, while the in-depth effect can still be maintained. This research aims to examine the effect of media type and media size when used in the second shot of double shot peening on hardness, roughness, and residual stress to identify the suitable conditions and compare them with single shot peening, such as conventional shot peening and fine shot peening, which was used as the first shot and second shot. Ti–6Al–4V was used as the substrate material, while various diameter sizes of silica and SUS304 media were selected as the media for the second shot in the process. The results showed that in the case of the larger size of silica media in the second shot of double shot peening, the hardness and residual compressive stress on the surface clearly increased more than with the smaller media due to the higher Almen intensity, which affected impact energy. On the other hand, when shooting with SUS304 media as a second shot, the increment of residual compressive stress and hardness, including roughness reduction on the surface, showed less effect than was the case for silica media, due to the lower Almen intensity, which affected the impact energy transfer. This research found that the condition of shooting with 80 μm of silica media as the second shot could generate the highest hardness and residual compressive stress on the surface, which increased by 14% and 53%, respectively, while roughness was decreased by 20% when compared with single shot peening.
Abstract: The results of the investigation on the influence of texture on chip formation during machining of Ti–6Al–4V alloy are reported in this work. Different textures are produced in this alloy by cold-rolling as-received and annealed material to 30–47% reductions. As-received and annealed samples exhibited basal and transverse textures while in cold-worked material, the basal texture disappeared and, a texture component with (0001) pole inclined at 70° from the Z direction was observed. Machining was done in these thermo-mechanically processed plates at a low cutting speed of 0.8 m/min to avoid temperature rise and the consequent microstructural modification. As-received and annealed material exhibited saw-tooth morphology of chips, while samples deformed to cold-work of 40% and above produced continuous chips with fine serrations at the free surface. Machined chips have retained the transverse texture in annealed material with reduced intensity, while the basal texture has disappeared in deformed material. The possible slip systems responsible for the development of these textures were identified using Schmid factors. The difference in morphology of chips between annealed and cold-worked samples is explained based on texture developed during machining, which has a bearing on the strain necessary for fracture initiation in the primary shear zone, thus affecting the spatial frequency of segmentation.
Abstract: In metal additive manufacturing, process-induced defects are a prime source of failure under cyclic loading at the present time. In this work, X-ray Computed Tomography was used to characterise the defect population inside the gauge volume of near-net shape manufactured dog-bone samples. The result further corroborates that crack initiating defects are at the lower tail of a positive-skewed size distribution, but not necessarily correspond to the largest defect. Contrary to common assumption, defects were not randomly located, but a clear tendency towards the free surface was observed. Then, from these surface defects, fatigue crack growth rates were measured using the replica technique. Although measured cracks were relatively small, e.g. below 1 mm, a similitude to long crack growth rates was demonstrated, when pore size was added to measured crack lengths. Finally, the crack initiation life from porosity was observed to be at least 50% of the total fatigue life based on the first detectable surface crack on the replica. This should be taken into consideration when using fracture mechanics for fatigue life prediction in presence of defects, where it is common to assume crack initiation from the very first cycle.
Abstract: In this work, the fundamental processing-structure-property (PSP) relationships that govern laser-based additive manufacturing were investigated with the Ti-6Al-4V alloy. X-ray synchrotron imaging carried out in conjunction with in-situ integrating sphere radiometry enabled real-time energy absorption measurements for a range of melting conditions that varied laser power and velocity. A thermal conduction model that incorporated the in-situ absorption data and final melt pool geometry was used to predict the thermal histories and diffusion distances along the heat-affected zone (HAZ) in the Ti-6Al-4V alloy to provide insight into the solid-state phase transformations that occurred in the unmelted regions adjacent to the melt pool. Resulting microstructural features were quantified using scanning electron microscopy techniques to elucidate changes in solidification behavior. Significant changes to α/β-Ti phase fractions were measured in the unmelted HAZ, across all test cases. Nanoindentation and scanning probe microscopy revealed differences in the hardness, modulus, and Volta potential across the resolidified melt pool, HAZ, and wrought base material. These measurements and simulations can be used to predict how processing changes lead to differences in the as-built performance of titanium parts that are used in aerospace and biomedical applications. This work demonstrates the utility of coupling in-situ absorption data with a conduction-only high speed model, which leads reasonable agreement with the synchrotron imaging measurements and microstructural transformations observed herein.
Abstract: The hot flow behavior, spheroidization, dynamic recrystallization (DRX) and fusing of lamellar ɑ phase for hot isostatic pressed Ti–6Al–4V titanium alloy was investigated at 950°C-900°C–850 °C with the total deformation amount of 70% during multi-pass deformation. The results show that all the flow stress value presented a peak value, followed by different flow softening extent. The flow stress is very susceptible to deformation parameters such as strain, strain rate and deformation temperature, and also the peak value decreased as the increase of temperature and the decrease of strain rate. The main softening mechanisms for different deformation pass are the DRX of β phase for one-pass deformation, spheroidization of lamellar α phase for two-pass deformation and DRX of α phase for three-pass deformation, respectively. The lamellar α spheroidization deformed in two-pass at 900 °C increased with decreased strain rate or the increased strain, and the maximum spheroidization fraction of lamellar α phase was 43% at 0.01s−1. The spheroidized mechanism of lamellar α phase is major give rise to the combined action of kinking deformation and element diffusion. Nevertheless, in the three-pass deformation process, the spheroidization degree did not significantly increase as increased strain, which principal give rise to the fusion of the same orientation of lamellar α phase. The fusion mechanism is the result of the joint action of the orientation of lamellar α phase and dislocation slip. And, the fraction of DRX of α phase is obviously higher than that of spheroidization in three-pass deformation, which is the main softening mechanisms.
Abstract: This study investigates the effect of high-pressure cutting fluid on the turning characteristics of Ti-6Al-4V alloy. A noncoated carbide tool was used to measure the cutting temperature using a tool-work thermocouple technique, and the cutting characteristics were evaluated with respect to the cutting temperature, chip breakability, and tool wear. Furthermore, the viability of TiAlN/AlCr2O3-coated tool was examined. The coolant jet when placed towards the cutting zone on the rake face is effective in reducing the cutting temperature because of the reduction in the chip-tool contact length. Based on this result, tools with a textured rake face were examined.
Abstract: Poor ductility is the primary concern of magnesium matrix composites (MMCs) inflicted by non-deformable ceramic particle reinforcements. Metal particles which melt at elevated temperature can be used as reinforcement to improve the deformation characteristics. Ti-6Al-4V particles reinforced AZ31 MMCs were produced through friction stir processing (FSP) which was carried out in a traditional vertical milling machine. The microstructural features as well as the response to external tensile load were explored. A homogenous distribution of Ti-6Al-4V was achieved at every part of the stir zone. There was no chemical decomposition of Ti-6Al-4V. Further, Ti-6Al-4V did not react with Al and Zn present in AZ31 alloy to form new compounds. A continuous strong interface was obtained around Ti-6Al-4V particle with the matrix. Ti-6Al-4V particles underwent breakage during processing due to severe plastic strain. There was a remarkable refinement of grains in the composite caused by dynamic recrystallization in addition to the pinning of smaller size broken particles. Dense dislocations were observed in the matrix because of plastic deformation and the associated strain misfit. Ti-6Al-4V particles improved the tensile behavior and assisted to obtain appreciable deformation before fracture. Brittle mode of failure was avoided.
Abstract: Ti-6Al-4V and Joining fiber reinforced polyether ether ketone resin matrix composite (PEEK-CFRTP) were joined directly by laser welding process. The joint microstructures and phases were analyzed. Results showed that the shear strength could reach 56.3kN/mm. Bubbles and cracks were found in joints, which impaired the strength of joint. The 'Anchor-shaped' structures at interface were also formed to strengthen the joint as the melted resin flowed into surface gap of titanium alloy. The microstructures showed that TiOF2, TiC, VC and the solution (Ti,V)C were found to form the joint. Finally, the joint formation mechanism was released according to the phased generated and joint microstructures.
Abstract: The isothermal compression of four typical microstructures in the cogging process for Ti-6Al-4V was conducted at strain rates ranging from 0.01 to 1 s−1 with varying temperatures. The flow behavior of different microstructures was compared. The Hansel-Spittel (H-S) and strain compensated Arrhenius (S-C-A) constitutive equations (CEs) were calibrated. To improve prediction ability, a modified H-S CE considering the evolution of microstructure was proposed and embedded in the finite element code. The original, modified H-S, and S-C-A CEs were evaluated based on the average absolute error (W) and relative error ratio (Δ%). Compared with the original H-S and S-C-A CEs, the W (−2.5%~2.5%) of the modified CE was found to be smaller and the Δ% was more concentrated. Furthermore, hot forging experiment and finite element simulation (FES) at different speeds were performed. The average relative error (AARE) of load-stroke for the H-S and modiﬁed H-S CEs is 13.51% and 3.67%, respectively. The comparisons between the FES and hot forging experiment indicate that the modified CE is more accurate for the simulation of the cogging process.
Abstract: Ti–6Al–4V alloy sheets were rolled at room temperature (293 K) and various cryogenic temperatures (173, 123, and 83 K). The microstructures of the specimens were characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. In addition, the hardness and tensile properties of the rolled sheets were systematically investigated. The results showed that under identical specimen thickness reductions, the grains became gradually refined, and dislocation densities increased with decreasing cryorolling temperature, furthermore, the β phase broke and became refined due to shear stress, while the hardness and strength values of the specimens increased. A hardness value of 383 HV was achieved when the rolling temperature was 83 K, and with a thickness reduction of 75%. In addition, we obtained a maximum tensile strength of 1329 MPa at 4.4% elongation, at a rolling temperature of 123 K and 75% thickness reduction. Thus, the increased dislocation density, grain refinement, and the high-density of the fine β phase were contributed to the improved mechanical properties of the specimens. In addition, the cryorolled sheets had good thermostability when the annealing temperature was not higher than 773 K.
Abstract: Titanium and its alloys have high specific strength and high resistance to corrosion but are expensive to manufacture. Manufacturing cost can be reduced by using metal injection moulding (MIM) to produce near-net shaped intricate parts. Feedstock rheology affects feedstock homogeneity, injection moulding and quality of the MIM parts. Methods to quickly obtain these rheological parameters will help optimise processing conditions and hence decrease manufacturing cost. Feedstocks were produced from hydride-dehydride titanium alloy powder and binder containing polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl butyral and stearic acid using a four-stage mixing process. Feedstock rheology and morphology were investigated using a capillary rheometer and a scanning electron microscope. A new model, which incorporates a newly defined parameter, feedstock flow index (p), was developed for predicting the rheological properties of titanium-based feedstocks using shear stress and melt flow rate. The MRF value, obtained from these low-cost rheological tests predicted HDH Ti-6Al-4V-MIM feedstock flow properties well.
Abstract: Expanded structural applications of additively fabricated or repaired components rely on a thorough understanding of relationships between the anisotropic microstructure and macroscopic mechanical properties. In the present study, Ti‐6Al‐4V as-built by laser metal deposition using a powder feedstock was investigated through an extensive characterization of microstructure, porosity and tensile properties along different loading directions. While no significant anisotropy in strength was noticed, the ductility was observed to vary significantly depending on the loading direction. Higher ductility along the build direction was found to result from strain delocalization using in-situ tensile tests combined with digital image correlation. Differences in mesoscale strain localization patterns stem from a specific distribution of α’ plates in relation to HAZ bands. In addition, the influence of a variety of other features including the crystallographic textures, the β grain morphology, the distance to the free surface, the porosity and the argon shielding during manufacturing on tensile properties was also examined and discussed in light of existing literature.
Abstract: Thermal spay coatings have been widely used to provide structural components with protection from harsh environments such as corrosion, heat, and wear resistance. However, delamination, pores or peeling defects may exist in an as-fabricated coating which influence the mechanical properties of the coating. We developed an eddy current testing (ECT) system using a special ECT probe. The ECT probe was composed of one detection coil and two excitation coils. The lower excitation coil was used to produce the excitation magnetic field in the specimen and the upper excitation coil was used to compensate the background signal. In this study, the feasibility of our ECT system to inspect the Ti-6Al-4V warm spray (WS) coatings were investigated. The artificial defects embedded between the Ti-6Al-4V coating and the substrate were successfully detected using the ECT system.
Abstract: The effect of the hydrogen content of 0.48 wt% and 1.38 wt% on the refinement of the microstructure of Ti-6Al-4V alloy produced by wire arc additive manufacturing was studied, and the microstructure evolution of Ti-6Al-4V alloy after hydrogenation, heat treatment and dehydrogenation was revealed in this work. The result shows that the Ti-6Al-4V alloy prepared by wire arc additive manufacturing technology consist of coarse columnar β grains with the lamellar α cluster inside. After hydrogenation treatment, the α clusters inside the β grains become smaller, and hydrides were produced. Then αʹ, αʹʹ and metastable phase βM were formed in the microstructure during the quenching from the temperature of Tp+ 10 °C. At last, the metastable phase and hydride were decomposed during the subsequent aging and dehydrogenation process, which significantly refines the α grains in the columnar β grains, forming a large area of a fine-grained microstructure. The shape and size of the original and hydrogen-removed grains was observed by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The result shows that the average size of the original lamellar α grains has been refined from 5.78 µm to 0.84 µm, especially, there were no original α grains with size above 4 µm left. With the hydrogen content of 0.48 wt%, the morphology of α grains after hydrogen removal is fine needle-like, while, when the hydrogen content increases to 1.38 wt%, the morphology of α grains is equiaxed.
Abstract: In this paper a novel cooling strategy is presented using a sub-zero metalworking fluid when milling Ti-6Al-4V. The metalworking fluid, composed of water and ethane-1,2-diol, was applied to the process at varied supply temperatures. An analysis of the occurring forces and temperatures, as well as the resulting surface integrity, is carried out. The surface integrity is characterized by microhardness measurements in the surface layer of the workpiece. Additionally, the surface topography is characterized using optical measuring techniques. The results are compared to those obtained using dry milling and when using a conventional cryogenic CO2 cooling strategy.
Abstract: Cutting tool surface texturing is emerging as an eco-friendly alternative to improve the tribological aspects and enhance machining performance. Despite several studies on the merits of textured cutting tools, limited information is available on their effect on chip segmentation. This study presents a quantitative analysis of the chip segmentation characteristics in dry machining of Ti-6Al-4V alloy using duel-textured carbide inserts. The optical and scanning electron microscopy analyses were performed to characterise the chip morphology. The effects of rake surface textures on segment width, shear angle, and chip thickness ratio were assessed and compared with the conventional inserts. In addition, the influence of surface textures on the microstructure of chip roots and the surface roughness of the workpiece was investigated. It appears that the textures on the rake face help reduce the spacing between the segments and the extent of fracture along the shear plane, ultimately reducing the segment strain and surface roughness. Therefore, this study facilitates the understanding of chip morphology and its evolution in turning operation using textured inserts and brings its industrial implementation a step closer.
Abstract: Variant selection, a common but complex phenomenon in Ti alloys, is not only governed by microstructural characteristics that affect the nucleation process of variants, such as grain orientation, grain boundaries, and residual α phase, but also remarkably influenced by some kinetic factors, such as cooling rate and residual stress, especially for the additive manufactured Ti alloys. To determine the influence of cooling rates on variant selection of laser solid formed (LSF) Ti-6Al-4V alloys, the selection of α variant in different zones of LSFed samples (possessing different cooling rates) but belonging to one single β grain was systematically studied. With the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) data, it was revealed that, though all 12 kinds of α variants appeared under different cooling rates, the area percentage of some variants remarkably deviated from the corresponding theoretical values at different cooling rates. To characterize the change of variant selection quantitatively, the length fraction of α/α boundary distinguished by types of angle/axis was further analyzed statistically. The results show that the length fraction of α/α boundary of type IV (63.26°/[−10 5 5 –3]) is larger than that of other types when the cooling rate is high (bottom zone) due to the high residual stress, while at low cooling rates (middle zone), the α/α boundary of type II (60°/[11–20]) dominates, which could be attributed to the self-accommodation mechanism during the β → α phase transition. The insights gained about the influence of cooling rate on the selection of α variant are helpful for understanding the microstructural evolution in LSFed Ti alloys.
Abstract: This study presents a method for designing a computationally informed gradient pathway to fabricate a functionally graded material (FGM) with terminal alloys of 316 stainless steel (SS316) and Ti-6Al-4V via directed energy deposition additive manufacturing with powder feedstock. The grading is accomplished through the introduction of intermediate elements and alloys (Ni-20Cr, Cr, and V) to avoid the brittle Fe-Ti intermetallic phases that form in the direct liquid phase joining of Ti-alloys and stainless steels. Using a combination of equilibrium calculations and Scheil-Gulliver simulations, a compositional pathway was designed to avoid deleterious phases. FGM samples were fabricated and experimentally characterized to determine the viability of the pathway. A change in phases from fcc to bcc was predicted to occur within the Ni-20Cr/Cr gradient region, and this was validated through experimental characterization. No detrimental phases (intermetallic, Laves, or σ phases) formed along the gradient path, demonstrating a successful computationally-informed design and fabrication of an FGM from SS316 to Ti-6Al-4V.
Abstract: This study reported a strategy of three-stage heat treatment to simultaneously improve yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation (EL) of laser melting deposited (LMDed) Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy. After the three-stage heat treatment, the basketweave microstructure consisting of acicular α laths in the as-built sample was transformed to a multiscale-α microstructure consisting of the coarse-plate α, fine-plate α and ultrafine α in the heat-treated sample. The effect of microstructure on the tensile properties was revealed via in-situ tensile test combined with the analysis of the deformation and fracture mechanism. Although the coarse-plate α in heat-treated sample is larger than the acicular α in as-built sample, the combination of multiscale α grains with a certain relative content aroused an increment of the YS from 879 ± 28 MPa in as-built sample to 973 ± 9 MPa in heat-treated sample. The good deformation compatibility among the multiscale α grains impeded the crack propagation effectively, which resulted in the improvement of the EL from 14 ± 2% to 16 ± 1%. Furthermore, the improvement of the EL enhanced the dislocation multiplication and strain hardening in the multiscale α microstructure to induce the increment of the UTS from 945 ± 40 MPa to 1092 ± 20 MPa. The results could provide a guidance for tailoring microstructure and improving the strength and ductility of additive manufacturing titanium alloy.
Abstract: Machining-induced residual stresses depend on the process parameters and are strongly influenced by the tool wear. The chip segmentation frequency in turning of Ti-6Al-4V can be obtained by processing signals of acoustic emission (AE) caused by the cutting process and used to estimate the tool wear condition. In this work, chip segmentation frequencies during longitudinal turning of Ti-6Al-4V are measured using AE sensors and correlated with the process parameters, abrasive tool wear and residual stresses. The resulting models allow for predition of significant characteristics in the residual stress distribution based on in-process measured chip segmentation frequencies.
Abstract: Building from a foundation of microstructural characterization, mechanical testing, 3D statistically equivalent microstructural volume elements (SEMVEs), and image-based microstructural modeling, this paper develops an effective crystal plasticity model with porosity evolution for additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V alloys. Their microstructure is characterized by a complex Widmanstätten morphology containing 12 α lath variants. In this paper, the morphology is parametrized by statistically equivalent ellipsoids, enabling a parametric representation of the α laths in the models. An effective crystal plasticity framework with the parametric representation of the α lath morphology is achieved by identifying the crystallographic relationship of the α laths in relation to the parent β grains from which they have nucleated and developing methods to incorporate a statistical representation of HCP α laths in β grains. The constitutive model for β grains statistically accounts for the size, shape, orientation, and crystallography of all 12 α lath variants. An important contribution is the integration of porosity evolution with the crystal plasticity model. The model is calibrated and satisfactorily validated with results from experiments on additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V alloys with and without heat treatment. The model can yield important insights into the underlying physics of this relatively new class of materials.
Abstract: The present work is aimed at utilizing an adapted version of the Fused-Filament Fabrication process as a means to produce hybrid joints comprised of sandblasted, rolled Ti-6Al-4V substrates and additively manufactured short carbon fiber-reinforced polyamide (PA-CF). Layer height (h), printing speed (v) and printing bed temperature (Tbed) for the coating layer (i.e. initial layer with unreinforced polyamide) were varied. Using the ultimate single-lap shear strength (ULSS) of the produced joints as a response, linear and polynomial regressions were fit to the experimental dataset using an approach based on Machine Learning. The linear model achieved a better accuracy, with a test R2 of 0.76. It was possible to conclude that the ULSS is strongly dependent on the actual coating layer height (hreal), which in turn depends on h and v. The optimal set of parameters resulted in an ULSS of 23.9 ± 2.0 MPa. Additionally, specimens for a three-point bending test based on the ISO 14679:1997 were produced and tested to further evaluate the influence of coating layer on mechanical behavior of hybrid joints, this time focusing exclusively on their interphase component. For this test, v did not play a statistically significant role, whereas h did.
Abstract: In this paper, the crack problem of welded joint between NiTi SMA and Ti-6Al-4V was studied. The crack morphology and propagation state were analyzed, which was found that the microstructure uniformity of the fusion zone was poor. And there was a eutectic reaction layer at the fusion line of Ti-6Al-4V. A large number of brittle compounds NiTi2 phase led to severe hardening of the welded joint. By means of thermodynamic calculation and finite element simulation, the precipitation of brittle phase and stress distribution were studied, and the formation mechanism of crack defects was clarified. According to the above research, the beam offset welding process was used to melt the NiTi SMA with low melting point, which by the fusion brazing method to achieve the reliable connection. Optimizing the microstructure of the fusion zone and eliminating crack defects, the most suitable electron beam offset amount was 0.4 mm.
Abstract: Residual stresses in the surface and subsurface of the machined part are important factors for surface integrity, which can significantly influence its performance and service life. Generally, the final machined surface could be finished by single- or multiple-pass cutting operation and the formation of residual stresses in each process have been widely studied, however few studies pay attention to the differences of residual stress generated by single- and multiple-pass strategy on the final machined surface. In single-pass cutting, the original unprocessed surface is often employed as initial state. While in multiple-pass, the previous cut often cause accumulated strain/stress and temperature on the machined surface/subsurface, which will affect the cutting forces, thermal distributions, plastic deformation in the subsequent cuts and eventually influence the final residual stresses. Thus this paper investigates the cutting forces, temperatures and residual stresses distributions in machining Ti-6Al-4V with the special emphasis on the differences between the single- and multiple-pass strategies. Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) method is used in FE modelling and experiments are also implemented. Good agreements were found between the experimental and numerical results, then further discussions based on the FE results can draw the conclusions that, the first cut in multiple-pass cutting strategy can lead to a decrease in cutting force and surface tensile residual stress in the second cut. The multiple-pass cutting strategy can result in a lower magnitude and depth of compressive residual stress in subsurface, and this is more obvious when a smaller ap is implemented in the sequential cut. This work can provide practical guidance for optimizing the cutting parameters to get the desired residual stress.
Abstract: The Low Cycle Fatigue (LCF) performance of an aero-engine bracket in a ‘struts and connectors’ design, made using the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process has been studied using strain controlled LCF tests at different Strain Ranges (SR). From the cyclic test results, the bracket has demonstrated that it meets the target LCF performance which was in excess of the normal expected operating loads that the LPBF bracket would experience. The failures in the bracket at different locations were observed only under the extreme loading conditions. The failure of the bracket was of a progressive nature with failure of different struts/connectors happening at different discrete cycles. Even after the first five failures, the LPBF bracket had 47% of the original load carrying capacity in the tensile part of the hysteresis loop, indicating a good redundancy in its load transfer paths. In general, the surface locations of the bracket struts/connectors, where there are lack of fusion voids, were the prime sites for crack initiation. If any of these locations also coincide with high stresses, i.e. the combination of ‘size of defect’ and ‘magnitude of stress’, then this will contribute to an increased likelihood of failure at these locations in the LPBF bracket.
Abstract: A computational model was developed to predict solid-state phase transformation kinetics within mechanical parts during metal additive manufacturing processes. This model is a modified version of the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami model for non-isothermal phase transformations that can be applied to various material systems undergoing solid-state phase transformations. Using the thermal history of an additive manufacturing fabricated mechanical part, along with the necessary thermodynamic data and kinetic information as inputs, the model outputs the history of phase fraction evolution during the build process. The model was applied to an Inconel 718 part built by powder bed fusion and a Ti-6Al-4V part built by directed energy deposition. Microstructure characterization and mechanical testing were performed for the validation of the model.
Abstract: Electron beam powder bed fusion/hot isostatic pressing (E-PBF/HIP), also known as in-situ shelling, is an emerging technology that produces components by only forming their shells whilst retaining sintered powder at the core, and then using HIP to consolidate the entire structure. E-PBF/HIP can boost additive manufacturing productivity, however, the fundamental understanding of the process-microstructure-property correlations remains unclear. Here, we systematically investigate the microstructural evolution of E-PBF/HIP Ti-6Al-4V parts as a function of hatch melting parameters. All HIPped samples achieve full densification, however, their microstructures are significantly different from one another. Using X-ray computed tomography (XCT) and optical microscopy, our results show that the HIPped Ti-6Al-4V microstructure can be controlled by varying the porosity, P (%), pore surface areas and morphology in the as-built parts with a single set of HIP parameters. The HIPped microstructures still exhibit the as-built columnar grains when the as-built porosity, P < 3 % with mainly spherical micro-pores; a mixture of columnar and equiaxed grains when the 3 % < P ≤ 5 % with a tortuous and interconnected pore network; and equiaxed grains when P > 5 % with a highly dense pore network. This work suggests two main drivers for the grain morphology transitions during HIP: (1) a dramatic increase in pore volume increases the localised applied pressure up to 4 times at the core region of the sample and (2) minimise lack-of-fusion pores with high surface energies, promoting dynamic recrystallisation. This study provides a fundamental insight into the E-PBF/HIP technology, showing the feasibility to tailor microstructural properties of E-PBF built parts whilst boosting additive manufacturing productivity.
Abstract: A lot of grinding research in the past has been emulated using single grit scratching. This limits studying surface generation mechanism due to overlapping scratches inherent to the grinding process. It not only affects the surface generation mechanism, but also limits studying elastic recovery which has a significant effect on the final form and topography including the roughness generated after grinding. Taking Ti-6Al-4V as a testbed, this investigation was directed on comparing single scratches with adjacent scratches, which are often referred to as double scratches in literature. During the experiments, the effect of scratch speed and the scratch separation distance on the cutting forces, material pile-up area ratio (PA), groove depth, material removal area (MRA), and sub-surface deformation were investigated. It was found that the scratch speed significantly affects the pile-up and groove depth because of phenomena like stress build-up and elastic recovery. A complementary analytical model of ploughing and shearing forces developed here led to the observation that the minimum chip thickness can only be around 0.1 to 0.2 times the radius of the indenter. Elastic recovery was found to be larger at the middle of the scratch, which was confirmed by the stress-strain relations derived from the FEM simulations. It was also observed that the spacing between two subsequent scratches can significantly affect the scratched surface quality. These experiments show that the severe ploughing and mid-region ridge features can be avoided by having the scratch pitch to be at least one third of the grit tip radius.
Abstract: Titanium alloys such as Ti-6Al-4V offer a potential lightweight alternative to traditional armour steels for ballistic protection due to their reduced density of approximately 60 % that of steel and tensile properties better than rolled homogenous armour steel. The manufacture of metallic armour often requires substantial thermomechanical processing to meet necessary ballistic performance specifications and thus restricts the complexity of armour designs. Additive manufacturing of Ti-6Al-4V has matured significantly in recent years, achieving outstanding mechanical properties in the as-built condition. In this study, Ti-6Al-4V plates were additively manufactured using both laser powder bed fusion and direct laser metal deposition for ballistic testing. The plates were built in different orientations and subjected to pre-heating or post heat-treatment to investigate the microstructural effect on the ballistic velocity limit (V50). The results show that plates with lamellar microstructure formed through martensite decomposition had higher V50 compared to lamellar microstructure formed via slow cooling through the β-transus. The post heat-treatment increased the V50 due to coarsening of the α-lath and stress relief. It is also apparent that anisotropy of the microstructure, specifically the columnar prior-β grains, affects the ballistic performance. A higher V50 was achieved when the columnar grains were aligned perpendicular to the projectile impact direction.
Abstract: This paper systematically investigated the effect of solution and artificial aging heat treatments on the microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of TiB/Ti–6Al–4V composites in situ fabricated by selective laser melting. The results showed that the fully martensite microstructure with TiB clusters of the as-built samples was transformed into lamellar α+β microstructure with TiB strips after solution heat treatment. With increasing the temperature, the α laths and TiB particles coarsened and the β volume fraction increased. After aging heat treatment, β volume fraction decreased and TiB had no obvious changes. A superior combination of the yield strength of (1146.8±28.2) ​MPa and even higher plasticity and ultimate compressive strength ((1680.1±18.3) ​MPa) than the as-built ones was obtained by solution heat treatment at 1000°C ​+ ​water quenching and aging at 600°C for 6 ​h ​+ ​air cooling.
Abstract: The creep response of a Ti‐6Al‐4V alloy produced by additive manufacturing was investigated at 500, 600, and 650 °C using constant load experiments. A collection of recent data from the literature on Ti‐6Al‐4V produced by conventional technologies and heat treated to produce different microstructures was analysed to determine the effect of the microstructure on the creep behaviour of this material. A unique constitutive equation derived from a model developed for face-centred cubic (fcc) metals was successfully used to describe the creep response, irrespective of the different microstructures. The same constitutive model was able to provide an excellent description of the minimum creep rate dependence on the applied stress for the alloy produced by additive manufacturing, notwithstanding the obvious differences in the microstructures. These observations led to the reconsideration of some consolidated opinions on the behaviour of Ti‐6Al‐4V, shedding light on the substantial similarities in the creep responses when the microstructure has different morphologies. The initial microstructural features, which have traditionally been thought to greatly influence the creep response, indeed played an important role because they determined the magnitude of the ultimate tensile strength, but this effect gradually disappeared at high temperatures and low stresses.
Abstract: In the present paper, a new four actuators fretting fatigue rig is presented. This machine is capable of performing tests at high or room temperature. Further, it is possible to independently control all the loads involved in the fretting tests (bulk, normal and tangential loads) in a static and cyclic way. In order to evaluate the influence of cyclic normal load on the fretting case, a new set of fretting fatigue and coefficient of friction tests were carried out for the Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Also, a finite element model (considering and neglecting wear) was used in conjunction with a critical plane parameter (SWT) and a non-local stress averaging approach to estimate fretting life. The experimental results have shown that cyclic normal load has a beneficial effect on fretting life compared with those under constant normal load. Further, no significant difference was noticed for the coefficient of friction measured under static and cyclic normal load conditions. Concerning the life estimate approaches considered in this work, for the constant normal load case, both implemented methodologies, whether accounting or neglecting wear, provided satisfactory results, with the former being slightly more accurate. However, life estimates were more accurate for the cyclic normal load case when disregarding wear.
Abstract: A 2D finite element model of three different rake angles (8°, 12° and 16°) was developed to simulate the peripheral milling of Ti-6Al-4V alloy. This was validated by machining experiments performed using a specially made solid carbide single flute fly cutter. The investigations indicated that this approach estimates the resultant cutting forces with prediction errors of 11%-26%, depending on the rake angle. This confirms the potential of finite element modelling to assist with the selection of cutting tool geometry for specific applications. However, this approach revealed that special attention should be paid to appropriate selection of the Johnson-Cook (J-C) constitutive parameters.
Abstract: This study demonstrates the possibility of the design of Ti-6Al-4V alloy surface properties by galvanostatic electrochemical treatment in a deep eutectic solvent Ethaline (a eutectic mixture of choline chloride and ethylene glycol in molar ratio 1:2, respectively) at the temperature of 25 °C. A short-time anodic treatment in Ethaline in a wide range of current densities (2–50 mA cm−2) provides formation of surface oxide films with controllable chemical composition, roughness and wettability, improved corrosion resistance and with biologically-inspired topography. It was found that a unique feature of this electrolyte in comparison with traditional acidic ones is that oxidation is not observed during electrochemical processing of titanium alloy. It was shown that formation of microrough structure on Ti-6Al-4V alloy surfaces is observed at relatively low current densities (2–15 mA cm−2) of the electrochemical treatment; formation of nanorough structure occurs at higher current densities (20–50 mA cm−2). It was found that all treated samples did not demonstrate any cytotoxic effect and have good cells adhesion and cells viabilities. Bacterial resistance of Ti-6Al-4V alloy samples can be controllably adjusted and increased by the surface leveling in Ethaline at high current densities.
Abstract: The metastable α' phase and dislocation characteristics (e.g., density and constituents) are of vital importance for the mechanical responses of (α+β) titanium alloys. In this work, to reveal the in-depth decomposition mechanisms of dislocations and metastable α' and their influences on mechanical properties in a Ti-6Al-4V (α+β) alloy, the thermal stability of different microstructures tailored by various cooling approaches were investigated utilizing scanning electron microscope, electron backscattered diffraction, transmission electron microscope and X-ray diffraction line profile analysis. The results showed that the initial characteristics of α' and α laths and dislocation density were influenced by the cooling methods remarkably. The thermal stability of Ti-6Al-4V alloy increased with decreasing cooling rate. The improvement in thermal stability can be ascribed by the decrement in dislocations, partitioning of the alloying elements and grain orientations variation of the α' lath and α phase. It is also found that the plastic strain accommodation of β→α' transformation was dominated by <a> dislocations. During stabilization annealing treatments, the <a>, <c> and <c+a> dislocations simultaneously decomposed. The decomposition of dislocations and metastable α' phase during various stabilization annealing and the particular twins and stacking faults microstructures formed during quenching have a great influence on the properties of the studied Ti-6Al-4V alloy.
Abstract: Micromilling of difficult-to-machine materials like Ti-6Al-4V alloy suffers from drawbacks such as tool wear and catastrophic tool breakage due to the tiny diameter of the micro tool. Hence, in this paper, an effort has been made to prolong tool life and improve surface quality via hybridization of water and CuO nanofluid-based MQL with PVD coated (AlTiN/TiAlN) and uncoated WC micro end-mill in micromilling of Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The results exhibited minimum surface roughness at lower concentration (0.25 vol%) of CuO nanofluids with AlTiN coated WC tool and diminished tool wear and built-up edge formation at higher concentration (1 vol%) water-based CuO nanofluids. Under various environmental conditions, the average size of the top burr width was determined on both the up and down milling sides. The minimum average burr width of 9.93 μm was obtained in up milling using 0.25 vol% CuO nanofluids condition with AlTiN coated tool. In the case of down milling, the minimum burr width was 10.58 μm when using 0.25 vol% CuO nanofluids with TiAlN coated tool. Furthermore, significant improvements in tool life and surface quality have been observed through the hybridized sustainable environments obtained by the combined utilization of MQL and coated tools.
Abstract: Coarsening of the basketweave α + β microstructure in Ti-6Al-4V is a common phenomenon that occurs during thermal cycling in both additive manufacturing and cyclic heat treatment. Such a coarsening process is driven by multiple dissolution and precipitation transformations rather than by conventional Ostwald ripening. It is clear that during the first cycle, the complete dissolution of the thinnest α plates at the heating stage provides large spaces for surviving plates to regrow at the cooling stage, which results in coarsening after the first cycle. However, it is still unclear how the α plates continue to vanish and the remaining α plates sustainably coarsen in the repeated thermal cycles. In this study, cyclic heat-treatment experiments and phase-field simulations were conducted to illustrate the mechanism of sustained coarsening during thermal cycling. It was found that in addition to the complete dissolution of the thinnest α plates in the first thermal cycle, α-plate vanishing continued during repeated thermal cycling in two ways, which has not been reported before. The origin of such sustained vanishing of α plates is related to the Gibbs–Thomson effect. Moreover, the influences of cycling frequency and total duration on the transformation coarsening are detected. Both the experimental and simulation results indicate that long cycling duration results in severe coarsening, while for a given duration time, the final coarsening of the α plates is almost independent of the cycling frequency.
Abstract: In this study, a Ti–Au cladding was deposited on a substrate from the Ti–6Al–4V alloy by the electron beam powder bed fusion method in a vacuum. The main goal was to assess the possibility of using titanium powders and gold foils as a feedstock for additive manufacturing of such dental products. The microstructure, chemical element distributions, phase composition and hardness of the formed Ti–Au alloy were studied using optical microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, as well as X-ray diffraction and nanoindentation tests. Gold-containing intermetallic compounds were observed through the entire cladding thickness. The α-Ti, α-Au, AuTi and AuTi3 phases were found, in addition to the Ti3Au one, which provided hardness values greater than those of conventional titanium alloys. It was shown by results of the crystal-geometric and X-ray phase analysis that the AuTi3 phase possessed the most densely packed A15 structure. This fact correlated with the obtained data on the deviation of the atomic volume per ion from Zen's law and the high hardness levels. Metallurgical patterns of the microstructure formation that affected the functional properties of such claddings were discussed and a further research direction was proposed.
Abstract: Cutting temperature is a critical factor which affects the thermal-mechanical behaviors of workpiece, the damage and wear of cutting tool. In this work, an analytical, numerical and experimental combined approach was developed to determine the heat partition to the milling tool. A thermo-mechanical model and the tool convective heat transfer model were established by an analytical method. The heat flux of the chip contact surface and the convective heat transfer coefficient of the milling cutter were predicted. To calculate the heat partition ratio to the milling tool, a finite element heat transfer simulation analysis of the temperature field of the milling cutter was carried out according to a milling kinematic analysis. A novel experimental method was designed to measure the instantaneous temperatures inside of tool, cutting edge and workpiece surface. The measured temperatures at different locations inside of the tool were applied to calibrate the heat distribution ratio to the milling tool. Additionally, the calculated instantaneous temperatures of the cutting edge by the heat partition ratios agreed well with the measured instantaneous temperatures of peripheral edges at various conditions, further validating the accuracy of the heat partition ratio. The temperature of the milling tool is proportional to the heat partition to the milling tool. The developed approach can provide effective method for controlling the performance of milling process according to the heat partition ratio.
Abstract: In this work, the influences of laser shock peening (LSP) on the residual stress state, microstructures and mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4V alloy fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM) were researched. Particularly, the microstructural evolution before and after LSP was clarified using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations. The results showed that the residual stress was adjusted from tensile to compressive state. Furthermore, high-density dislocations and a great number of parallel nano mechanical twins (nano-MTs) were promoted in the coarse lamellar α' structures, contributing to the grain refinement. The ultimate tensile strength and elongation of the SLM-manufactured (SLMed) Ti-6Al-4V alloy increased by approximately 14.3% and 18.3% after LSP treatment, respectively. Finally, the dominant mechanism of tensile property enhancement by LSP was revealed. High levels of compressive residual stress and grain refinement of the α' structures induced by LSP realized the excellent combination of strength and ductility.
Abstract: Microstructure transformation and mechanical properties of Ti–6Al–4V based on laser wire deposition were studied with the addition of different contents Cu. With the addition of 5.4 wt% Cu, deposited alloy firstly transformed into martensite under rapid cooling conditions. In subsequent cyclic heating of additive manufacturing, martensite decomposed into α phase and nodular Ti2Cu phase. With the addition of 6.8 wt% Cu, active eutectoid reaction was stimulated in the deposited alloy that directly transformed into nanoscale lamellar α+Ti2Cu microstructure under fast cooling conditions. However, under the subsequent cyclic heating, nanoscale Ti2Cu served as nucleation site, developed into micron-size pro-eutectoid Ti2Cu. Couple the effect of refine grain strengthening, solid solution strengthening and dispersion strengthening, tensile strength of deposite was increased approximately 58%, and tensile strain was only reduced approximately 6% after 5.4 wt% Cu was added. When the addition was 6.8 wt% Cu, the tensile strength declined by about 6%, and tensile strain dropped by probably 66%, since stress concentration was easily caused by micron-size pro-eutectoid Ti2Cu in deposit.
Abstract: TiC-Co layer was fabricated on Ti-6Al-4V alloy plate by TIG cladding route using TiC/Co powder blend of equal weight ratio. The distance between the electrode and the work, namely stand-off-distance (SOD), was varied between 4 and 6 mm during the TIG arc scanning, which altered the arc volume and subsequent heat intensity in the powder melt pool. A significant variation in the clad track width and depth was noticed due to the discrepancy in the arc-workpiece interaction area for increasing the SOD. Although almost uniform thickness in the clad layer was obtained, owing to discrepancies in the specific density and thermal conductivity between TiC, Co powder, and Ti-6Al-4V substrate, the constituents of the clad layer were found in-homogenously distributed. Consequently, a marginal diversity in the micro-hardness and wear resistance of the clad layer was recorded for the alteration of SOD conditions. Variation in the concentration of partially melted spherical shaped TiC particles, resolidified dendritic TiC, and other intermediate phases alter the microhardness value in different regions of the clad layer. The results indicated that the wear value or height reduction of the clad specimen was up to 15 times lower than the substrate material when tested against hardened steel. In contrast, the wear value was reduced almost three times when tested against the alumina abrasive disc under different load conditions.
Abstract: Due to dramatic thermal gradients and cooling rates induced by Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF), Ti-6Al-4V as-built parts show a fine martensitic microstructure with high residual stresses that are detrimental for their mechanical behaviour. In order to optimize the properties and meet the product requirements, post-processing heat treatments are often compulsory. The present work first describes the microstructure (residual stresses, beta grains and laths size, crystallographic texture) and the mechanical behaviour (impact and tensile tests) of as-built parts with raw surface. Then, one discusses the effect of a stress-relieve sub-transus heat treatment on the strength/ductility compromise.
Abstract: Titanium and its alloys are widely used in orthopedic implant surgery due to their good mechanical properties and biocompatibility. Recent studies have shown that the healing process of fractures involve not only the calcification of osteoblasts but also the regulation of the immune system. The functionalization of titanium surface coatings is one of the most important methods for solving implant failures. In this study, monetite (CaHPO4) was coated on the Ti-6Al-4V porous scaffold by hydrothermal method. SEM, XRD and EDS were used to characterize the morphology, phase constitutes, elemental content of the coating, respectively. The results indicated that a well bonded and uniformly distributed monetite coating obtained, and the degradation performance and Ca2+ release of the surface coating were also studied. In terms of biology, live/dead staining and CCK8 methods showed the coating had good biocompatibility and BMSCs can adhere and proliferate on the surface. Flow cytometry and ELISA indicated that the surface monetite-coating had good anti-inflammatory properties. Through RNA-seq analysis, it was shown in KEGG that the osteoclast-related pathway was inhibited. In vitro, monetite induced osteogenic gene expression in BMSCs and inhibited the activity of osteoclasts. In vivo experiments showed that the monetite-coating increased bone formation. In summary, monetite-coating can effectively promote the osteogenesis in BMSCs, which may be achieved through bone immune regulation.
Abstract: In this study, the corrosion behaviors of macro/micro/nano-scale surface modifications of Ti-6Al-4V dental implant for bio-implants were investigated. For this purpose, macro/micro/nano-scale surface roughness was formed on the surface of Ti-6Al-4V alloy using plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO), anodization, and sandblasting. Potentiodynamic and potentiostatic methods were used to investigate the corrosion behavior of the samples. The surface properties of the alloy were observed using field-emission scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry. The bulk sample exhibited scratches in the vertical direction created by the machine. The sandblasted sample showed an indented trace instead of a machined scratch. The PEO-treated sample showed different pore shapes in the screw valley, screw flank, and screw top. Nanotubes were uniformly formed in the α phase but not well formed in the β phase. In the case of nanotubes on sandblasting, the nanotubes were not well formed in the defect areas formed during the sandblasting process. In a corrosion test, the corrosion potential significantly increased with no surface treatment, whereas it significantly decreased when defects or pores were formed on the surface. The current density–time curves revealed that the sandblasted specimen showed the most unstable film behavior and in the case of the nanotube and nanotube-on-sandblasting specimens, the current density increased with time.
Abstract: A key challenge for metal additive manufacturing is the requirement to adapt process-structure-property methods currently under development to realistic, complex geometries. Of specific concern in the present work is the requirement for accurate computation in such realistic geometries of (i) thermal histories, to facilitate microstructure prediction, and hence, mechanical properties, and (ii) residual stresses, as required for accurate assessment and design for structural integrity, such as fatigue cracking. This paper presents three-dimensional, finite element modelling for simulation of a realistic Ti-6Al-4V component using directed energy deposition. The predicted results are successfully validated against published experimental and numerical data. The effects of different scanning strategies on temperature histories and residual stresses are investigated as a basis for identification of optimal manufacturing protocols. Finally, fatigue life predictions of the Ti-6Al-4V component have been considered based on the Basquin-Goodman equation with the effect of residual stress taken into account.
Abstract: Although the post-annealing of additively manufactured materials is an important process in obtaining reliable mechanical properties, it is still not comprehensively understood how the annealing conditions affect the microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of an additively manufactured Ti–6Al–4V alloy. In this study, the effect of post-annealing on the mechanical properties exhibited by a direct energy deposition processed Ti–6Al–4V alloy was investigated by subjecting samples of the alloy to varying annealing conditions and tensile testing temperatures. Depending on the annealing temperature, post-annealing can induce microstructural changes, including lath growth, local misorientation relief, and prior β grain transition, each of which contribute to the strength reduction and ductility increase observed during the tensile test. The tensile testing temperature affects the slip system activity observed in the Ti–6Al–4V alloy; as the temperature increases, the critical resolved shear stress is reduced. Based on the prismatic and basal slip system activation, a significant strain hardening capability and ductility were observed in the tensile deformed Ti–6Al–4V at elevated temperatures. This result alludes to the detailed deformation mechanisms exhibited by the additively manufactured and post-annealed Ti–6Al–4V, which can then be used to optimize the properties exhibited by metallic products through the application of post-treatments.
Abstract: Orientation induced anisotropic hardness and modulus of Ti-6Al-4V alloy has been minimized through microstructural engineering. This involves the formation of martensite upon quenching and further its decomposition facilitated by cold deformation and low temperature heat treatment. The martensite (α′) formed from the β phase has nearly equal distribution of multiple variants in the form of fine laths. After decomposition, this transforms to fine equiaxed β along the lath boundaries of α, instead of a thin lamellar β. The variations in the nano-indentation derived hardness and modulus are much smaller compared to the reported literature and is attributed to the fine nature and morphology of the constituent phases.
Abstract: Laser peen forming (LPF) is a metal forming process that utilizes laser-induced mechanical shock waves to form desired shapes or modify bent structures. The present work focuses on the applicability of LPF to Ti-6Al-4V sheets, to identify an optimal LPF process parameter window and achieve desired bending without compromising the surface quality within the peened region. The effect of LPF process parameters, i.e. laser power density, overlap, type of sacrificial overlay, and the number of peening sequences was investigated for specimens with different thicknesses. The laser power density and number of peening sequences were the most influential parameters that affect the bending of the specimens. Using sacrificial overlay has a significant effect on the bending and surface quality of the specimens. Surface quality after LPF was assessed by measuring the roughness in the peened region. In experiments without a sacrificial overlay, a black titanium oxide residue on the peened region was observed and additionally, small micro-cracks were found in the near surface region. Further characterization of the peened region revealed that the average crack length increased with increase in laser power density. Two possible LPF process parameter combinations were identified to obtain bending in the peened region, where LPF with sacrificial overlay resulted in no surface damage. Furthermore, residual stresses were determined at various LPF process parameters by incremental hole-drilling method in the peened region.
Abstract: To improve the surface biocompatibility, hardness, and corrosion resistance in a simulated human environment, monolayer Ta coating and multilayer Ti-Zr-Ta and Zr-Ti-Ta coatings are prepared by magnetron sputtering on Ti-6Al-4V substrates. Vickers hardness and nanoindentation reveal that the coatings improve the surface hardness of the investigated alloy. Moreover, the coatings improved the corrosion behavior of the alloy, which is mainly attributed to that the coatings changed the composition of the passivation film. The multilayer coatings effectively hinder the growth trend of the columnar structures. Finally, the all sputtered coatings have excellent cytocompatibility.
Abstract: Remelting and grain growth in deposited layers and the columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET) have a significant impact on microstructural evolution during the multilayer printing process. A three-dimensional phase-field model incorporating a heterogeneous nucleation model was developed to study the microstructural evolution under different scanning strategies and scanning velocities during directed energy deposition (DED) additive manufacturing. An experiment was performed to validate the predicted grain morphologies using the proposed model. The results indicate that undercooling determines the extent of heterogeneous nucleation and controls the CET. In comparison with constitutional undercooling and curvature undercooling, thermal undercooling contributes more to the DED of Ti–6Al–4V. The maximum undercooling occurs on the top layer leading to a higher ratio of equiaxed grain formation. The undercooling increases with the build height, which is beneficial for the CET. The growth direction of the columnar grains is controlled by the size and shape of the melt pool. The bidirectional scanning strategy leads to bent columnar grains as a result of the changing growth direction between adjacent deposited layers. The decrease in the scanning velocity leads to coarsening of the grains.
Abstract: The effect of cutting edge radius (30–55 μm) during milling Ti–6Al–4V under minimum quantity cooling lubrication (MQCL) conditions is studied. A trial study is conducted to compare the performance of dry, wet, and MQCL using unprepared tools with edge radius of 30 μm alone. Subsequently, inserts having initial radius of 30 μm are prepared to 40–55 μm radius using drag finishing and milling of Ti–6Al–4V under MQCL is studied for different edge radii. Rounded edge tools are found to produce thinner and more curvilinear chips resulting in easier chip removal from the machining zone. The chip thickness and curl radius were up to 54% and 47% lower for the larger edge radius tools as compared to the 30 μm edge radius tool. This improves the penetration of the MQCL aerosol jet into the cutting zone thus producing better tribological results. The better penetration of MQCL aerosol into the cutting zone for larger edge radius tools results in lowering the resultant process forces (up to 16%), tool-chip interface temperature (15%), tool wear (40%) and surface roughness (30%) for the 48 μm radius tool as compared to the unprepared (30 μm) tool. There is deterioration in process forces, tool wear and surface integrity for the 55 μm tool possibly suggesting the existence of an optimum edge radius closer to 48 μm.
Abstract: This paper investigates the mid-cycle fatigue (MCF) behavior of as-built DED Ti-6Al-4V. Fatigue tests in groups at three stress levels were completed in a laboratory environment. The results show that internal pore initiation mode is more common for this material. The porosity-induced crack initiation mechanism involves a mixture of cleavage and intergranular fracture. Pore size classification method is quantitatively developed, which in turn elucidate the potential relationships among microstructure, pore size, fatigue behavior, and fatigue crack growth stages in high vacuum. A quantitative study of pore sizes and fine granular area (FGA) shows that the FGA stress intensity factor range ΔKFGA in the MCF regime is not a material constant. In addition, three key factors (i.e., stress level, pore size and pore-to-surface distance) affecting the fatigue behavior and performance of the material are discussed.
Abstract: Titanium matrix composites reinforced with in situ formed titanium boride whiskers have long aroused significant interest for advanced applications in fields such as aerospace, biomedicine, and armaments. However, processing approaches dedicated to fabricating these composites have usually been limited by the cost-performance dilemma, thereby limiting commercial success. Blended elemental powder metallurgy (BEPM) has historically been the most economical route to produce titanium-based composites. At the same time, the need to reduce undue sinter porosities has imposed complicated and expensive extra thermomechanical steps in BEPM manufacturing. In the present study, nearly dense Ti–6Al–4V-based composites reinforced with in situ synthesized titanium monoborides (TiB) are prepared by simple press-and-sinter hydrogen-assisted BEPM without hot deformation or hot pressing using TiH2, TiB2, and master alloy (Al–V) powder blends as starting material. Vacuum sintering of compacted powder blends results in the formation of a dehydrogenated Ti–6Al–4V matrix with excessive porosity and unevenly distributed partially reacted TiB2 particles. Such an inappropriate pre-sintered microstructure can be completely transformed into low-porosity uniform Ti–6Al–4V/TiB composites with tailored grains by using hydrogenation and milling of pre-sintered material into hydrogenated pre-alloyed powders and, finally, by using these powders in a second press-and-sinter processing step. The useful influence of hydrogen as a temporary alloying element on microstructure formation is discussed. The densification of hydrogenated powder compacts upon vacuum heating, and the hydrogen emission from the material is studied via dilatometric tests. The evolution of microstructure and phase composition during processing steps was investigated by scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction. Compressive tests were used to evaluate the mechanical properties of materials produced after the first and second sintering. The results show that hydrogen-assisted BEPM can be a cost-effective route for in situ fabrication of Ti–6Al–4V/TiB composites with reliable mechanical properties.
Abstract: In this paper, an alternating current (AC) was added to filling wire in the arc deposition process. The effect of alternative current on grains size and microstructure of Ti-6Al-4V cladding layers were studied. The microstructure evolution, grain size distribution, texture, and crystal twining of cladding layers with the addition of alternative current were studied in detail using metallographic microscopy (OM), electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD), and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The results reveal that the addition of AC can effectively inhibit β grain growth, the grains size decrease with the increase of AC value. The enhancement of microstructure uniformity and decrease of texture intensity have been realized by electromagnetic force produced by alternative current. Additionally, the {10-10}<10-12> compression twins system was observed in cladding layer at 45A.
Abstract: Aiming at the difficulty of feeding filler wire in the dual laser-beam synchronous welding (DLSW) of Ti–6Al–4V titanium alloys T-joints, the self-fusion DLSW process based on prefabricated welding materials on the stringer was developed. Prefabricated bosses on both sides of the stringer were used as welding materials. In this paper, the influence of boss size and laser power on the weld formation was studied. The influence of microstructure transformation on mechanical properties was demonstrated. It is found that T-joints with desirable weld formation can be obtained when the boss size of 0.8 × 0.8 mm2 was applied. The temperature distribution of the T-joint during laser welding process was obtained by finite element simulation method. It indicates that the cooling rate of fusion zone is 140 °C/s, indicating that massive transformation occurs in the fusion zone. The microstructure of fusion zone characterized by acicular martensite plates α′ and a small amount of intergranular α phase meets with the cooling rate of FZ. Due to multiple strengthening effects, the average microhardness of fusion zone is 351.6 HV, which is higher than the average microhardness of base material. The pull-out strength of T-joint is not related to the weld penetration, and its average pull-out strength is 1035.5 MPa. The fracture occurred in the weld toe of the pull-out specimen, and fracture surface presents quasi-cleavage fracture characteristics.
Abstract: Microstructure quantification is becoming an important ingredient for predicting material behavior. Here, we present a methodology to quantify 2-phase (α + β) basketweave Ti-6Al-4 V microstructures printed by a wire feed directed Energy Deposition (DED) process. The method focuses on automated quantification of features, such as α lamella thickness and volume fractions of both (α + β) phases, to ensure repeatability and to enable comparison across a wide array of images for subsequent analysis using pre-defined open access image processing libraries in the Python Language. A stereological correction was made for α-lath spacing based on the work of Collins et al. [1], while also assuming area fraction (in 2D images) as equivalent to volume fraction of (α + β) phases. Further, the results were compared with a commercial software package that uses a similar methodology. The methodology is expected to be generally applicable to lamellar microstructures and to other microstructure types via adaptation of the methodology for the features in question.
Abstract: Longitudinal ultrasonic vibration-assisted milling (LUVAM) was performed to improve the machinability and surface quality of titanium alloys Ti-6Al-4V under dry conditions. Effects of ultrasonic amplitude on the three-component cutting forces, cutting temperature, surface topography and 3D surface roughness (Sa and Sq) were investigated. The results show that, the cutting forces in both longitudinal and feed directions decrease with the increasing amplitude from 0 to 6 µm, as well as the average and maximum cutting temperature. Accordingly, the surface topography of Ti-6Al-4V becomes more uniform when ultrasonic amplitude reaches to 6 µm. Sa and Sq decrease by 35.1% and 34.0%, respectively, when the ultrasonic amplitude increases from 0 to 6 µm. The machinability and surface quality of Ti-6Al-4V are improved via this dry LUVAM, duo to the thermal-mechanical coupling resulted from large-amplitude ultrasonic vibration. The established approaches have potential applications in dry or near dry cutting of difficult-to-machine alloys with LUVAM.
Abstract: Additively manufactured (AM) alloy usually inevitably contains defects during the manufacturing process or in service. Defect, as a harmful factor, could significantly reduce the fatigue performance of materials. This paper shows that the location and introduced form of defects play an important role in high cycle fatigue and very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) behavior of selective laser melting Ti-6Al-4V alloys. The S-N curve descends approximately linearly for internal defect induced failure. While for artificial surface defect induced failure, the S-N curve descends at first and then exhibits a plateau region feature. The competition of interior crack initiation with fine granular area feature is also observed in VHCF regime. The paper indicates that only the size or the stress intensity factor range of the defect is not an appropriate parameter for describing the effect of defect on fatigue crack initiation. Finally, the effect of artificial surface defect on high cycle fatigue and VHCF strength is modeled, i.e., the fatigue strength σ, fatigue life N and defect size area (square root of the projection area of defect perpendicular to principal stress direction) is expressed as σ=CNaarean,N<N0CN0aarean,N≥N0, where C, a and n are constants, and N0 is the number of cycles at the knee point of the curve.
Abstract: The influence of electrochemical charging of hydrogen at j = −5 mA/cm2 for 6, 12, 48 and 96 h on the structural and the mechanical behavior of wrought and electron beam melting (EBM) Ti–6Al–4V alloys containing 6 wt% β and similar impurities level was investigated. The length of the α/β interphase boundaries in the EBM alloy was larger by 34% compared to that in the wrought alloy. The small punch test (SPT) technique was used to characterize the mechanical behavior of the non-hydrogenated and hydrogenated specimens. It was found that the maximum load and the displacement at maximum load of the wrought alloy remained nearly stable after 6 h of charging, showing a maximum decrease of ∼32% and 11%, respectively. Similarly, hydrogenation of the EBM alloy resulted in a gradual degradation in mechanical properties with charging time, up to ∼81% and 86% in pop-in load and displacement at the “pop-in” load, respectively. The mode of fracture of the wrought alloy changed from ductile to semi-brittle with mud-cracking in all hydrogenated specimens. In contrast, the mode of fracture of the EBM alloy changed from a mixed mode ductile-brittle fracture to brittle fracture with star-like morphology. The degraded mechanical properties of the EBM alloy are attributed to its α/β lamellar microstructure which acted as a short-circuit path and enhanced hydrogen diffusion into the bulk as well as δa and δb hydride formation on the surface. In contrast, a surface layer with higher concentration of δa and δb hydrides in the wrought alloy served as a barrier to hydrogen uptake into the bulk and increased the alloy resistivity to hydrogen embrittlement (HE). This study shows that EBM Ti–6Al–4V alloy is more susceptible to mechanical degradation due to HE than wrought Ti–6Al–4V alloy.
Abstract: Identifying micro-texture regions (MTR) in deformed Ti-6Al-4V requires extensive time in electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) imaging with a field of view that is limited to only a few millimeters. This study uses a novel method of high throughput identification of MTR using polarized light microscopy (PLM) and validation by correlation with orientation image mapping from EBSD. Reflection of polarized light under crossed polars leads to a difference in contrast depending on the orientation of the c-axis of the α-phase. MTR that are spread over a large area are visible in PLM as bands of contrast and the field of view is large compared to EBSD maps. It is shown that the shape and size of MTR may be captured accurately in PLM, and a one-to-one correspondence is demonstrated with such regions identified by EBSD with an excellent match between the area fraction of MTR calculated using both methods.
Abstract: Ti–6Al–4V alloy samples with 4000 ppm oxygen are fabricated by metal injection molding. The samples are subjected to a heat-treatment, in which the samples are solution-treated below the β transus and subsequently water-quenched. The tensile tests on the samples indicate that the plastic elongation of the alloy is successfully improved from 1.0 to 3.2% by the heat-treatment. Investigation on the microstructural evolution in the heat-treatment shows that an acicular α phase, existing in the β lamellar structure of the as-sintered samples and harmful for its ductility, is suppressed by quenching and effectively eliminated from the heat-treated samples. Moreover, in the solution treatment, the alloy splits into a primary α phase and a β phase. In the water quenching, the β phase is transformed into a lamellar structure of secondary α phase and β phase with improved ductility. As a result, the improved ductility of the heat-treated samples derives from the plastic deformation of the ductile lamellar structures and the synergic displacement of the rigid primary α phase.
Abstract: Structural materials properties are highly dependent on their microstructure. Their microstructure is in turn affected by multiple fabrication and thermo-mechanical treatment parameters, all of which conform a highly-dimensional parametric space with often hidden correlations that are difficult to extract by experimentation alone. This is particularly true for alloys of the dual-phase Ti-6Al-4V family, with their greatly complex and rich microstructures, which combine several intrinsic lengthscales associated with multiple grain and subgrain structures, grains with different crystal lattices (α and β phases), and complex chemistry. Here we use a comprehensive set of machine learning techniques to develop predictive tools relating the yield strength and hardening rate of these alloys to a set of input parameters covering extensive ranges. The data generator is a finite-element crystal plasticity model for polycrystal deformation that takes into account slip anisotropy and employs standard dislocation evolution models for the α and β phases of Ti-based alloys. Our dataset includes over two thousand independent simulations and is used to train the machine learning models, which are then used to establish correlations between microstructural parameters and the alloys’ mechanical response. Our results point to the most influential parameters affecting yield strength and hardening rate, information that can then be used to guide experimental synthesis and characterization efforts to save time and resources.
