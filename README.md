material knowledge extraction

Informationï¼š
The Ti alloy material knowledge base construction method obtains material knowledge based on open source literature. Through key phrase clustering analysis, named entity recognition, rule templates and multiple constraint methods, a material knowledge extraction system is developed to facilitate the construction of the material gene library and provide possibilities for material genetic engineering.

1. Obtain Ti knowledge from open source literature and build a database

2. The content includes key phrase clustering analysis, rule templates, conditional constraints, named entity recognition research results, etc.

3. Includes the analysis process of some data, statistical information, etc.
